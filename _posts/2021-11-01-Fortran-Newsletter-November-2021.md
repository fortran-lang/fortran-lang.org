Please help improve stdlib by testing and [reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22reviewers+needed%22)!

The candidate for file system operations to be included in stdlib is being developed by
[@MarDiehl](https://github.com/MarDiehl) and [@arjenmarkus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus)
in [this repository](https://github.com/MarDiehl/stdlib_os).
Please try it out and let us know how it works, if there are any issues, or if the API can be improved.

`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/main/PACKAGING.md)
to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/main/manifest-reference.md)
to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.

* Browse existing *fpm* packages on the [fortran-lang website](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/fpm)
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

## Events

* We have adopted two new Fortran-lang guidelines:
  - [Governance document](https://github.com/fortran-lang/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) that describes how Fortran-lang projects are managed
  - [Administration, moderation, and editing guide](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/welcome-to-discourse/7#administration-moderation-and-editing-3) for Fortran Discourse
  Both documents are part of an effort to increase transparency between Fortran-lang administrators and the rest of the community.
* The US Fortran Standards Committee (J3) held the meeting 225 October 18-27, 2021.
  The meeting was virtual and on Mondays and Wednesdays only.
  Discussions focused on resolving any outstanding issues to the Fortran 202X features.
  Here are the links to the meeting [agenda](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/21/agenda225.txt),
  [minutes](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/21/minutes225.txt),
  and [papers](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/meeting/225).
  See also the [Fortran-lang and LFortran liaison report to J3](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/21/21-206.txt)
  submitted by Ondřej Čertík and Milan Curcic.
* We had our 19th Fortran Monthly call on October 19.

As usual, subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.io/g/fortran-lang) and/or
join the [Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group) to stay tuned with the future meetings.
