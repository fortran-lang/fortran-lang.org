Please help improve stdlib by testing and [reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22reviewers+needed%22)!

The candidate for file system operations to be included in stdlib is being developed by
[@MarDiehl](https://github.com/MarDiehl) and [@arjenmarkus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus)
in [this repository](https://github.com/MarDiehl/stdlib_os).
Please try it out and let us know how it works, if there are any issues, or if the API can be improved.

## Fortran Package Manager

`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/tutorial)
to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/spec/manifest.html)
to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.

* Browse existing *fpm* packages on the [fortran-lang website](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/fpm)
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

## Compilers

### Flang

TODO @AlexisPerry

### LFortran

TODO @certik

We are looking for new contributors. Please do not hesitate to contact us if
you are interested. We will help you get up to speed.

## Events

* fpm has a new documentation website hosted at
  [fpm.fortran-lang.org](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/).
  This website will provide user-oriented tutorials and how-to guides, as well
  as developer-oriented reference documents and specifications.
  We welcome all contributions to the fpm documentation, including translations
  to other languages.
  Please visit the [fpm-docs repo](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-docs) to
  get started.
* We had our 21st Fortran Monthly call on December 14.
  You can watch the recording below:

* We also wrote a review of the Fortran-lang projects in 2021. Read it
  [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/newsletter/2021/12/29/Fortran-lang-2021-in-review/).

As usual, subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.io/g/fortran-lang) and/or
join the [Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group) to stay tuned with the future meetings.
