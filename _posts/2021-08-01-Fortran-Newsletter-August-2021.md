Please help improve stdlib by testing and [reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22reviewers+needed%22)!

The candidate for file system operations to be included in stdlib is being developed by
[@MarDiehl](https://github.com/MarDiehl) and [@arjenmarkus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus)
in [this repository](https://github.com/MarDiehl/stdlib_os).
Please try it out and let us know how it works, if there are any issues, or if the API can be improved.

## Fortran Package Manager

Here's what's new in fpm:

* [#507](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/507):
  optimize file listing
* [#511](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/511):

Work in progress:

  proposal to close #525 by generating build/.gitignore
* [#527](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/527) (WIP):

* [#498](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/498) (WIP):
  Draft - Compiler flags profiles

`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/PACKAGING.md) to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/manifest-reference.md) to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.
* Browse existing *fpm* packages on the [fortran-lang website](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/fpm)
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

* FortranCon 2021 will be held virtually from September 23-24, 2021.
Registration is free of charge and is due by September 15.
The first call for abstracts is due August 1, and the second is due September 1.
For more information, visit the [FortranCon website](https://tcevents.chem.uzh.ch/event/14/).

* Work is well under way started for our Google Summer of Code program. Read about our students and their progress so far on Discourse: <https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/c/gsoc-2021/11>
  
As usual, subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.io/g/fortran-lang) and/or
join the [Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group) to stay tuned with the future meetings.
