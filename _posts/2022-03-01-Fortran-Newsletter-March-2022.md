`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/tutorial)
to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/spec/manifest.html)
to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.

* Browse existing *fpm* packages on the [fortran-lang website](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/fpm)
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

## Events

* Fortran-lang has been selected as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code 2022!
  Thanks to everybody who helped prepare the application.
  [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is Google's global, online program that allows newcomers to open-source to work on a project and get paid for it. 
  See the [Fortran-lang GSoC 2022 page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/fortran-lang) for information about the projects and how to apply.
  Applications for contributors open **April 4** and close **April 19**.
  To learn more about GSoC and what has changed since last year, please see the [GSoC 2022 announcement](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/11/expanding-google-summer-of-code-in-2022.html).
  If you'd like to participate as a contributor or a mentor, please let us know in this thread and we'll help you get started.
* Fortran-lang community now maintains a modernized fork of the classic library
  [minpack](https://github.com/fortran-lang/minpack). Give it a try!
* We had our 23rd Fortran Monthly call on February 15.
  You can watch the recording below:

* US Fortran Standards Committee meeting #226 started on February 28.
  See the draft agenda [here](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/22/agenda226.txt)
  and the submitted papers [here](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/meeting/226).

As usual, subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.io/g/fortran-lang) and/or
join the [Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group) to stay tuned with the future meetings.
