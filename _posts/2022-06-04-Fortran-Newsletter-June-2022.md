Please help improve stdlib by testing and [reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22reviewers+needed%22)!

The candidate for file system operations to be included in stdlib is being developed by
[@MarDiehl](https://github.com/MarDiehl) and [@arjenmarkus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus)
in [this repository](https://github.com/MarDiehl/stdlib_os).
Please try it out and let us know how it works, if there are any issues, or if the API can be improved.

`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/tutorial)
to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/spec/manifest.html)
to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.

* Browse existing *fpm* packages on the [fortran-lang website](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/fpm)
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

## Events

* The Fortran-lang Google Summer of Code 2022 program began on May 23.
  We welcome five contributors: Arteev Raina, Ashirwad Mishra,
  Henil Shalin Panchal, Mohd Ubaid Shaikh, and Oshanath Rajawasam.
  They will be working on exciting projects from fpm and the Fortran
  website to improving the LFortran compiler.
  Read more about their projects [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/fortran-lang).
* We had our 26th Fortran Monthly call on May 16.
