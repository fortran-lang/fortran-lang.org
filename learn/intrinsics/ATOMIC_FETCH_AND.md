## __Name__

__atomic\_fetch\_and__(3) - \[ATOMIC:BIT MANIPULATION\] Atomic bitwise AND operation with prior fetch


## __Syntax__
```fortran
call atomic_fetch_and(atom, value, old, stat)
```
## __Description__

__atomic\_fetch\_and(atom, value, old)__ atomically stores the value of
__atom__ in __old__ and defines __atom__ with the bitwise AND between the values of
__atom__ and __value__. When __stat__ is present and the invocation was successful,
it is assigned the value __0__. If it is present and the invocation has
failed, it is assigned a positive value; in particular, for a coindexed
__atom__, if the remote image has stopped, it is assigned the value of
iso\_fortran\_env's stat\_stopped\_image and if the remote image has
failed, the value stat\_failed\_image.

## __Arguments__

  - __atom__
    : Scalar coarray or coindexed variable of integer type with
    atomic\_int\_kind kind.

  - __value__
    : Scalar of the same type as __atom__. If the kind is different, the value
    is converted to the kind of __atom__.

  - __old__
    : Scalar of the same type and kind as __atom__.

  - __stat__
    : (optional) Scalar default-kind integer variable.

## __Examples__

Sample program:

```fortran
program demo_atomic_fetch_and
use iso_fortran_env
implicit none
integer(atomic_int_kind) :: atom[*], old
   call atomic_fetch_and (atom[1], int(b'10100011101'), old)
end program demo_atomic_fetch_and
```
