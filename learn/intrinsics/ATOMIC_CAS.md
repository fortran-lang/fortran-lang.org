## __Name__

__atomic\_cas__(3) - \[ATOMIC\] Atomic compare and swap
(GFDL)

## __Syntax__
```fortran
call atomic_cas (atom, old, compare, new, stat)
```
## __Description__

atomic\_cas compares the variable __atom__ with the value of __compare__; if the
value is the same, __atom__ is set to the value of __new__. Additionally, __old__ is
set to the value of __atom__ that was used for the comparison. When __stat__ is
present and the invocation was successful, it is assigned the value 0.
If it is present and the invocation has failed, it is assigned a
positive value; in particular, for a coindexed __atom__, if the remote image
has stopped, it is assigned the value of iso\_fortran\_env's
stat\_stopped\_image and if the remote image has failed, the value
stat\_failed\_image.

## __Arguments__

  - __atom__
    : Scalar coarray or coindexed variable of either integer type with
    atomic\_int\_kind kind or logical type with atomic\_logical\_kind
    kind.

  - __old__
    : Scalar of the same type and kind as __atom__.

  - __compare__
    : Scalar variable of the same type and kind as __atom__.

  - __new__
    : Scalar variable of the same type as __atom__. If kind is different, the
    value is converted to the kind of __atom__.

  - __stat__
    : (optional) Scalar default-kind integer variable.

## __Examples__

Sample program:

```fortran
program demo_atomic_cas
use iso_fortran_env
implicit none
logical(atomic_logical_kind) :: atom[*], prev
   call atomic_cas(atom[1], prev, .false., .true.)
end program demo_atomic_cas
```
