## __Name__

__co\_sum__(3) - \[COLLECTIVE\] Sum of values on the current set of images


## __Syntax__
```fortran
call co_sum(a, result_image, stat, errmsg)
```
## __Description__

co\_sum sums up the values of each element of __a__ on all images of the
current team. If result\_image is present, the summed-up values are
returned in __a__ on the specified image only and the value of __a__ on the
other images become undefined. If result\_image is not present, the
value is returned on all images. If the execution was successful and
__stat__ is present, it is assigned the value zero. If the execution failed,
__stat__ gets assigned a nonzero value and, if present, __errmsg__ gets assigned
a value describing the occurred error.

## __Arguments__

  - __a__
    : shall be an integer, real or complex variable, which has the same
    type and type parameters on all images of the team.

  - __result\_image__
    : (optional) a scalar integer expression; if present, it shall have
    the same the same value on all images and refer to an image of the
    current team.

  - __stat__
    : (optional) a scalar integer variable

  - __errmsg__
    : (optional) a scalar character variable

## __Examples__

Sample program:

```fortran
program demo_co_sum
implicit none
integer :: val
   val = this_image()
   call co_sum(val, result_image=1)
   if (this_image() == 1) then
      ! prints (n**2 + n)/2, with n = num_images()
      write(*,*) "The sum is ", val
   endif
end program demo_co_sum
```
  Results:
```text
    The sum is            1
```
