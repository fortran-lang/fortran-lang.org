## __Name__

__asin__(3) - \[MATHEMATICS:TRIGONOMETRIC\] Arcsine function

## __Syntax__
```fortran
result = asin(x)

    elemental TYPE(kind=KIND) function asin(x)
    TYPE(kind=KIND) :: x
```
where the returned value has the kind of the input value 
and TYPE may be _real_ or _complex_

## __Description__

__asin(x)__ computes the arcsine of its argument __x__.

The arcsine is the inverse function of the sine function. It is commonly
used in trigonometry when trying to find the angle when the lengths of
the hypotenuse and the opposite side of a right triangle are known.

## __Arguments__

  - __x__
    : The type shall be either _real_ and a magnitude that is less than or
    equal to one; or be _complex_.

## __Returns__

  - __result__
    : The return value is of the same type and kind as __x__. The real part of
    the result is in radians and lies in the range __-PI/2 \<=
    asin(x) \<= PI/2__.

## __Examples__

The arcsine will allow you to find the measure of a right angle when you
know the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse.

So if you knew that a train track rose 1.25 vertical miles on a track
that was 50 miles long, you could determine the average angle of incline
of the track using the arcsine. Given

     sin(theta) = 1.25 miles/50 miles (opposite/hypotenuse)

```fortran
program demo_asin
use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : dp=>real64
implicit none
! value to convert degrees to radians
real(kind=dp),parameter :: D2R=acos(-1.0_dp)/180.0_dp
real(kind=dp)           :: angle, rise, run
character(len=*),parameter :: all='(*(g0,1x))'
  ! given sine(theta) = 1.25 miles/50 miles (opposite/hypotenuse)
  ! then taking the arcsine of both sides of the equality yields
  ! theta = arcsine(1.25 miles/50 miles) ie. arcsine(opposite/hypotenuse)
  rise=1.250_dp
  run=50.00_dp
  angle = asin(rise/run)
  print all, 'angle of incline(radians) = ', angle
  angle = angle/D2R
  print all, 'angle of incline(degrees) = ', angle

  print all, 'percent grade=',rise/run*100.0_dp
end program demo_asin
```

Results:
```
    angle of incline(radians) =    2.5002604899361139E-002
    angle of incline(degrees) =    1.4325437375665075
    percent grade=   2.5000000000000000
```
The percentage grade is the slope, written as a percent. To calculate
the slope you divide the rise by the run. In the example the rise is
1.25 mile over a run of 50 miles so the slope is 1.25/50 = 0.025.
Written as a percent this is 2.5 %.

For the US, two and 1/2 percent is generally thought of as the upper
limit. This means a rise of 2.5 feet when going 100 feet forward. In
the US this was the maximum grade on the first major US railroad, the
Baltimore and Ohio. Note curves increase the frictional drag on a
train reducing the allowable grade.

## __Standard__

FORTRAN 77 and later, for a complex argument Fortran 2008 or later
