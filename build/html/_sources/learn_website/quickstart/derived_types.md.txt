As discussed previously in [Variables]({{site.baseurl}}/learn/quickstart/variables), there are five built-in data types in Fortran. A _derived type_ is a special form of data type that can encapsulate other built-in types as well as other derived types. It could be considered equivalent to _struct_ in the C and C++ programming languages.

## A quick take on derived types

Here's an example of a basic derived type:

```fortran
type :: t_pair
  integer :: i
  real :: x
end type
```

The syntax to create a variable of type `t_pair` and access its members is:
```fortran
! Declare
type(t_pair) :: pair
! Initialize
pair%i = 1
pair%x = 0.5
```

{% include note.html content="The percentage symbol `%` is used to access the members of a derived type." %}

In the above snippet, we declared an instance of a derived type and initialized its members explicitly.
You can also initialize derived type members by invoking the derived type constructor.


Example using the derived type constructor:
```fortran
pair = t_pair(1, 0.5)      ! Initialize with positional arguments
pair = t_pair(i=1, x=0.5)  ! Initialize with keyword arguments
pair = t_pair(x=0.5, i=1)  ! Keyword arguments can go in any order
```

Example with default initialization:
```fortran
type :: t_pair
  integer :: i = 1
  real :: x = 0.5
end type

type(t_pair) :: pair
pair = t_pair()       ! pair%i is 1, pair%x is 0.5
pair = t_pair(i=2)    ! pair%i is 2, pair%x is 0.5
pair = t_pair(x=2.7)  ! pair%i is 1, pair%x is 2.7
```

## Derived types in detail

The full syntax of a derived type with all optional properties is presented below:

```
type [,attribute-list] :: name [(parameterized-declaration-list)]
  [parameterized-definition-statements]
  [private statement or sequence statement]
  [member-variables]
contains
  [type-bound-procedures]
end type
```

## Options to declare a derived type

`attribute-list` may refer to the following:

- _access-type_ that is either `public` or `private`
- `bind(c)` offers interoperability with C programming language 
- `extends(`_parent_`)`, where _parent_ is the name of a previously declared derived type from which the current derived type will inherit all its members and functionality
- `abstract` -- an object oriented feature that is covered in the advanced programming tutorial

{% include note.html content="If the attribute `bind(c)` or the statement `sequence` is used, then a derived type cannot have the attribute `extends` and vice versa." %}

The `sequence` attribute may be used only to declare that the following  members should be accessed in the same order as they are defined within the derived type. 

Example with `sequence`:
```fortran
type :: t_pair
  sequence
  integer :: i
  real :: x
end type
! Initialize
type(t_pair) :: pair
pair = t_pair(1, 0.5)
```
{% include note.html content="The use of the statement `sequence` presupposes that the data types defined below are neither of `allocatable` nor of `pointer` type. Furthermore, it does not imply that these data types will be stored in memory in any particular form, i.e., there is no relation to the `contiguous` attribute." %}

The _access-type_ attributes `public` and `private`, if used, declare that all member-variables declared below will be automatically assigned the attribute accordingly. 

The attribute `bind(c)` is used to achieve compatibility between Fortran's derived type and C's struct.

Example with `bind(c)`:
```fortran
module f_to_c
  use iso_c_bindings, only: c_int
  implicit none

  type, bind(c) :: f_type
    integer(c_int) :: i
  end type

end module f_to_c
```
matches the following C struct type:
```c
struct c_struct {
  int i;
};
```
{% include note.html content="A fortran derived type with the attribute `bind(c)` cannot have the `sequence` and `extends` attributes. Furthermore it cannot contain any Fortran `pointer` or `allocatable` types." %}

`parameterized-declaration-list` is an optional feature. If used, then the parameters must be listed in place of `[parameterized-definition-statements]` and must be either `len` or `kind` parameters or both. 

Example of a derived type with `parameterized-declaration-list` and with the attribute `public`:
 ```fortran
module m_matrix
  implicit none
  private

  type, public :: t_matrix(rows, cols, k)
    integer, len :: rows, cols
    integer, kind :: k = kind(0.0)
    real(kind=k), dimension(rows, cols) :: values
  end type

end module m_matrix

program test_matrix
  use m_matrix
  implicit none

  type(t_matrix(rows=5, cols=5)) :: m

end program test_matrix
 ```
{% include note.html content="In this example the parameter `k` has already been assigned a default value of `kind(0.0)` (single-precision floating-point). Therefore, it can be omitted, as is the case here in the declaration inside the main program." %}

{% include important.html content="By default, derived types and their members are public. However, in this example, the attribute `private` is used at the beginning of the module. Therefore, everything within the module will be by default `private` unless explicitly declared as `public`. If the type `t_matrix` was not given the attribute `public` in the above example, then the compiler would throw an error inside `program test`." %}

The attribute `extends` was added in the F2003 standard and introduces an important feature of the object oriented paradigm (OOP), namely inheritance. It allows code reusability by letting child types derive from extensible parent types: `type, extends(parent) :: child`. Here, `child` inherits all the members and functionality from `type :: parent`.

Example with the attribute `extends`:
```fortran
module m_employee
  implicit none
  private
  public t_date, t_address, t_person, t_employee
  ! Note another way of using the public attribute:
  ! gathering all public data types in one place.

  type :: t_date
    integer :: year, month, day
  end type

  type :: t_address
    character(len=:), allocatable :: city, road_name
    integer :: house_number
  end type

  type, extends(t_address) :: t_person
    character(len=:), allocatable :: first_name, last_name, e_mail
  end type

  type, extends(t_person)  :: t_employee
    type(t_date) :: hired_date
    character(len=:), allocatable :: position
    real :: monthly_salary
  end type

end module m_employee

program test_employee
  use m_employee
  implicit none
  type(t_employee) :: employee

  ! Initialization

  ! t_employee has access to type(t_date) members not because of extends
  ! but because a type(t_date) was declared within t_employee.
  employee%hired_date%year  = 2020  
  employee%hired_date%month = 1
  employee%hired_date%day   = 20

  ! t_employee has access to t_person, and inherits its members due to extends.
  employee%first_name = 'John'  
  employee%last_name  = 'Doe'
  
  ! t_employee has access to t_address, because it inherits from t_person,
  ! which in return inherits from t_address.
  employee%city         = 'London'
  employee%road_name    = 'BigBen'
  employee%house_number = 1

  ! t_employee has access to its defined members.
  employee%position       = 'Intern'
  employee%monthly_salary = 0.0

end program test_employee
``` 

## Options to declare members of a derived type

`[member-variables]` refers to the declaration of all the member data types. These data types can be of any built-in data type, and/or of other derived types, as already showcased in the above examples. However, member-variables can have their own extensive syntax, in form of:
`type [,member-attributes] :: name[attr-dependent-spec][init]`

`type`: any built-in type or other derived type

`member-attributes` (optional):

- `public` or `private` access attributes
- `protected` access attribute
- `allocatable` with or without `dimension` to specify a dynamic array
- `pointer`, `codimension`, `contiguous`, `volatile`, `asynchronous`

Examples of common cases:

```fortran
type :: t_example
  ! 1st case: simple built-in type with access attribute and [init]
  integer, private :: i = 0
  ! private hides it from use outside of the t_example's scope.
  ! The default initialization [=0] is the [init] part.

  ! 2nd case: protected
  integer, protected :: i
  ! In contrary to private, protected allows access to i assigned value outside of t_example
  ! but is not definable, i.e. a value may be assigned to i only within t_example.

  ! 3rd case: dynamic 1-D array
  real, allocatable, dimension(:) :: x
  ! the same as
  real, allocatable :: x(:)
  ! This parentheses' usage implies dimension(:) and is one of the possible [attr-dependent-spec].
end type
```

{% include note.html content="The following attributes: `pointer`, `codimension`, `contiguous`, `volatile`, `asynchronous` are advanced features that will not be addressed in the *Quickstart* tutorial. However, they are presented here, in order for the readers to know that these features do exist and be able to recognize them. These features will be covered in detail in the upcoming *Advanced programing* mini-book." %}

## Type-bound procedures

A derived type can contain functions or subroutines that are *bound* to it. We'll refer to them as _type-bound procedures_. Type-bound procedures follow the `contains` statement that, in turn, follows all member variable declarations.

{% include note.html content="It is impossible to describe type-bound procedures in full without delving into OOP features of modern Fortran. For now we'll focus on a simple example to show their basic use." %}

Here's an example of a derived type with a basic type-bound procedure:

```fortran
module m_shapes
  implicit none
  private
  public t_square

  type :: t_square
  real :: side
  contains
    procedure :: area  ! procedure declaration
  end type

contains

  ! Procedure definition
  real function area(self) result(res)
    class(t_square), intent(in) :: self
    res = self%side**2
  end function

end module m_shapes

program main
  use m_shapes
  implicit none

  ! Variables' declaration
  type(t_square) :: sq
  real :: x, side

  ! Variables' initialization
  side = 0.5
  sq%side = side

  x = sq%area()
  ! self does not appear here, it has been passed implicitly

  ! Do stuff with x...

end program main
```
What is new:

 - `self` is an arbitrary name that we chose to represent the instance of the derived type `t_square` inside the type-bound function. This allows us to access its members and to automatically pass it as an argument when we invoke a type-bound procedure.
 - We now use `class(t_square)` instead of `type(t_square)` in the interface of the `area` function. This allows us to invoke the `area` function with any derived type that extends `t_square`. The keyword `class` introduces the OOP feature polymorphism.

In the above example, the type-bound procedure `area` is defined as a function and can be invoked only in an expression, for example `x = sq%area()` or `print *, sq%area()`. If you define it instead as a subroutine, you can invoke it from its own `call` statement:

```fortran
! Change within module
contains
  subroutine area(self, x)
    class(t_square), intent(in) :: self
    real, intent(out) :: x
    x = self%side**2
  end subroutine

! ...

! Change within main program
call sq%area(x)

! Do stuff with x...
```
In contrast to the example with the type-bound function, we now have two arguments: 

* `class(t_square), intent(in) :: self` -- the instance of the derived type itself
* `real, intent(out) :: x` -- used to store the calculated area and return to the caller
