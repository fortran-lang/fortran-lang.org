            "text": "Currently Fortran implements special functions in an inconsistent way.\nAs an example, sin, cos, exp are supported for all complex arguments. But the error function is only available for real arguments (complex implementation provided as a library). The Bessel functions are only defined for integer orders (I had to implement my own for half integer orders).\nWe should develop criteria by which to decide what special functions belong into standard Fortran, and which don't.\nThere are several ways to go about it. The three main approaches that come to my mind are listed below, there are probably others (please propose them below).\nOption 1\n\nFortran should have no special functions, but rather those should be delegated to libraries such as stdlib.\n\nAs a consequence, the Bessel functions already in Fortran should be deprecated.\nOption 2\n\nWe decide on classes of special functions to include, and we should include all (complex) variants and all parameters.\n\nAs a consequence, we should add the remaining Bessel functions, and erf for complex arguments.\nOption 3\n\nWe decide on subset of a class of special functions, based for example on what is provided by libm (part of GNU libc).\n\nThat seems to be the current approach.",

This will provide a solid (trusted) reference implementation that is being used by (hopefully) a lot of people. Then the most frequented special functions could be considered for inclusion into Fortran itself. Or perhaps left in stdlib if stdlib becomes popular.\n\nOption 6\n\nAs fpm becomes more popular, ensure good implementations of special functions are available as libraries, implemented correctly and easy to use as dependencies as fpm packages. Later on, we can consider adding them to stdlib or the Fortran standard itself.\n\n\nThe advantages of Option 5 and 6 are that they are low friction, but they provide high value: as an example, I had to implement my own implementation of Bessel functions because the (Fortran) implementation in SciPy was providing incorrect values in some cases."

            "text": "One of the most annoying restrictions in the language is that Fortran's default constructors for derived types do not always allow one to initialize the private fields of these types. That is, if one has a derived type like the following,\ntype :: AClass\n   private\n   class(BClass), allocatable :: b\ncontains\n   procedure :: some_method_of_aclass_that_uses_b\nend type AClass\n\n\nas it happens extremely frequently in object-oriented programming, then the language will typically forbid passing some instance of BClass to the default constructor that generates objects of type AClass, e.g. the following, perfectly reasonable code, would not be allowed\nsubroutine some_other_procedure(b)\n   class(BClass), intent(in) :: b\n      \n   ! local declaration of an object of AClass\n   class(AClass), allocatable :: a\n\n   ! initialization using default constructor of AClass\n   a = AClass(b)\nend subroutine some_other_procedure\n\n\nif some_other_procedure is not a part of the module in which AClass is declared. One has to either\n\nremove the private access specifier from the  AClass derived type, in order to be able to use the default constructor, which is unacceptable in object-oriented programming, since the latter relies critically on implementation hiding, or\nwrite a user-defined constructor (despite the obvious triviality of the above example), with all the hoop-jumping and verbosity that this involves in Fortran, like overloading the name of the derived type, etc.\nput all these declarations into the same module, which is rarely possible in practice.\n\nThe net result presently is that the object-oriented programmer has to write user-defined constructors for all but the very simplest of his classes (namely those that contain no fields at all)!\nAllowing the initialization of private components by Fortran's default constructors, even if these are called from external scoping units, would go a long way in removing some of the drudgery that the language presently imposes on object-oriented programmers.",

Hence, the programmer can rightly expect that the language's main facility to construct such derived types (the default constructor) will work equally well for both these application cases, i.e. structures and classes.\nWell, it doesn't.\nIt works for structures, but not (in general) for classes (where implementation hiding is of paramount importance). I consider this a design flaw in the language, a \"wart\" as such things have been called in the past. It makes the language inconsistent, and hence nonintuitive to use, especially for newbies.\nGood, consistent design would provide a single default means to construct instances of both cases, consistent with the language's aim of offering only a single feature to support both structures and classes. It is ok if the language wishes to offer more functionality (like, e.g., user-defined constructors) than the bare minimum required by consistency, but the bare minimum (the default constructor) must work!\nSo, my proposal is essentially one of \"wart removal\", as it has been done repeatedly in the past."

This is wrong.\nDerived types as a whole have their own access specifiers, that are independent of the access specifiers of their components. The standard is very clear about this. Section \"7.5.2.2. Accessibility\" states (I'm quoting from the draft for ballot of the 2018 standard, so the numbering might not be the final one):\n\"The accessibility of a type name is determined as specified in 8.5.2.

The two constraints you mention are then natural consequences of such requirements."

One would need to explicitly assign to the entity twice, or explicitly deallocate for finalization to happen, which the compiler could in theory detect. However, calling a function with polymorphic result would require the result be deallocated and possibly finalized after the function call, as the result is just a temporary entity.\nThis brings to mind another question. Is there something in the standard that requires a temporary, an assignment and a deallocation for a statement like the following, or would the compiler be allowed to optimize that away?\npolymorphic_variable = polymorphic_function(with, args)\nBut that question probably deserves its own thread."

DEC added unions as part of its STRUCTURE/RECORD extension in 1985, but J3/WG5 never seriously considered adding unions as far as I know. Some considered unions like EQUIVALENCE, a bad programming practice. In an ideal world, I would agree, but there are just too many places where non-Fortran APIs use unions (Windows API for one) and the lack of a way to represent these in Fortran is considered a defect.\nGiven that a common use of unions is in C-friendly APIs, I want to propose unions in the context of C interoperability. Here is my idea:\n\nSupport the DEC UNION/MAP syntax for interoperable types only\nDisallow types with an \"ultimate component\" of a union from: formatted I/O without DT, default initialization, structure constructors (only those that don't give names for all their components?). Am I missing anything? I thought about intrinsic assignment, but I think this is OK since an interoperable type can't contain a pointer, allocatable or coarray component. Basically, the things that imply a component order would be excluded.\n\nMany compilers already support the DEC syntax, so this would be relatively easy to implement.\nAs a reminder, it would look something like this:\ntype, bind(C) :: union_type\n  union\n    map \n      integer : I\n    end map\n    map\n      real :: R\n    end map\n  end union\nend type union_type\ntype(union_type) :: UR\n\nOne could then reference UR%I or UR%R which would share the same memory location.

Rather, the facility in Fortran should have additional characteristics when it comes to interoperability with C.  One can see that with the CHARACTER type.\nFor example, UNION can perhaps be an attribute of a derived type in Fortran with certain restrictions: its components are all either intrinsic and/or other derived types of UNION types, there are no ALLOCATABLE components, nor are there any type-bound procedures allowed nor generic bindings and so forth similar to those with SEQUENCE types (but without any baggage of the SEQUENCE types for sure).  The semantics of a type with a UNION attribute will be such that the STORAGE_SIZE of an object of said type is sufficient to contain the largest of the type components.\nBut that the BIND(C, ..) attribute brings additional semantics into effect toward interoperability with a C companion processor where each component in a union-type needs to be interoperable and the storage aspects then follow those of the companion processor e.g., with respect to any padding considerations.\nRegardless, the DEC Fortran extension that includes MAP sections look not only unnecessary but also not modern for standard Fortran.  It will be preferable if the Fortran standard excluded anything with MAP that is currently in DEC Fortran.\nAlso, it should be possible for a derived type to have a component that of a derived type with a UNION attribute regardless of whether the hosting derived type is a UNION type.\nThus a facility can look like so:\ntype, UNION :: some_union_type  !<-- see the attribute\n   integer :: i\n   real :: r\nend type\n\ntype, UNION, BIND(C) :: some_interoperable_union_type\n   integer(c_int) :: i\n   real(c_float) :: r\nend type\n\ntype, UNION, BIND(C) :: some_other_interoperable_type\n   type(some_interoperable_union_type) :: foo\n   character(kind=c_char,len=1) :: bar(N) !<-- where N is a named constant, or a constant expression, etc.\nend type"

What is the use case of your version?\n..\n\nThe use case(s) I am referring to include all the situations in a pure Fortran context, with no involvement of a companion C processor, where Fortranners have a need for a union type.\nThe scenarios I am referring can include something as simple as\n   type, union :: foo_t\n      double precision :: x\n      character(kind=K, len=N) :: s\n   end type\nwhere such a type is consumed using a processor with support toward DOUBLE PRECISION that conforms to Fortran standard but whose interoperability with a companion C processor is of no relevance to the program at hand.  And the same with the CHARACTER type whose kind K has no relevance to 'C_CHAR' kind and where the program logic can depend on the length 'N' of a scalar component 's'.\nAs I wrote in my earlier post, there is a genuine need for a union type in Fortran which is not restricted in any way by the interoperability considerations with a companion C processor.\nIt's common in simulations (e.g., Physics simulations of particles) to work with \"blobs\" of data where\n\non the computational side of the program, the blob holds pertinent data consisting of Fortran intrinsic types including the floating-point formats that conform to the Fortran standard but not necessarily those of a C processor, and other intrinsic types including INTEGER, CHARACTER, and LOGICAL.  But\non the data management side of the simulation program the blob may be an array of some primitive type supported by the Fortran processor and conformant to the Fortran standard e.g., an array of an arbitrary INTEGER or CHARACTER types that conform to Fortran standard but which have no relevance to a companion C processor,\n\nBut I acknowledge also the importance of a union type in the context of interoperation with a companion C processor, a common scenario being one on Windows OS e.g., where a Fortran program needs to work with user input on a console using Microsoft Windows API ReadConsoleInput.\nThat's why I suggest the thought process and vision toward such a feature in Fortran be broader and that the development of any proposal strives to include both of the above needs in order to serve the best interests of Fortran practitioners."

You can watch the recording here.\nOn the call we came to an overall tentative agreement that the 3rd form of split may be not appropriate or intuitive to be part of the split functionality. As a reminder, the 3 forms of split, after 20-007 and 20-139 are:\n\nSPLIT (STRING, SET, TOKENS [, SEPARATOR])\nSPLIT (STRING, SET, FIRST, LAST)\nSPLIT (STRING, SET, POS [, BACK])\n\nWhile we found that the first two forms are useful and meaningful for split, we also found that the 3rd form is not appropriate because it doesn't actually do any splitting. Instead, it does \"finding\", which is more akin to the intrinsic index. Bundling the 3rd form of the currently approved split with the other two may thus be confusing to Fortran programmers.\nWe decided to write a proposal against exclude the 3rd form in the split intrinsic for F202X. I have agreed to take a lead on it. I plan to have a PR draft in this repo by early December, so it can be discussed ahead of time both here and on the J3 mailing list and/or forum well ahead of time."

                    "text": "To move the discussion forward a bit, I want to discuss a little bit about how this would probably work in Fortran. First, Fortran is a statically typed, compiled language, so for the simple use case - like deconstructing an array (or maybe deconstructing an object of known type), with a simple assignment statement, you would probably want to ensure at compile time that the pattern match cannot fail. I.e. for the statement [x, y, z] = coords, coords must be declared with size 3, and the same type and kind parameters as x, y, and z.\nNext, one would want to have a branching construct for possible matches. The most natural syntax would be (I think) to reuse the select construct like:\nselect case (coords)\ncase (Point_2D_t(x, y))\n  ! can now do stuff with x and y\ncase (Point_3D_t(x, y, z))\n  ! can now do stuff with x, y and z\ncase default\n  ! coords is still in scope, but we don't necessarily know it's type or components\nend select\nI don't think Fortran's type system is suited to check at compile time whether all possible matches have been accounted for, so I think a default branch would be required. Or, it could be that if one isn't specified, the processor must automatically insert one of the form:\ncase default\n  error stop \"Pattern match not satisfied for <select-expr>\"\nSince Fortran is an imperative language, there's also the possibility of just letting it fall through, and none of the branches are executed. This is the way existing select case and select type blocks work, so it would be consistent. However, if it is required, one could relax the restriction that the assignment statement form be guaranteed to succeed, and instead treat it more like syntactic sugar for the expanded form, where:\n[x, y, z] = coords\nis equivalent to\nselect case (coords)\ncase ([x, y, z])\n   ! all following statements\ncase default ! inserted at end of scope\n  error stop \"Pattern match not satisfied for 'coords'\"\nend select"

More examples where it provides value might be useful to aid in the evaluation.\nI would be opposed to a change that ends up forcing even those cases with fixed size to be accessed within SELECT RANK clauses.\nA related thought:  SELECT RANK is not so bad when there is only one assumed-rank array involved.   Once there are multiple such arrays and even if you know they are all the same rank, you end up being forced to nest multiple select ranks.   E.g., consider the case where I have 3 such dummy arguments b1, b2, b3 and as a final step I want to add them and store the result back into b1.    Maybe they can only be rank 2 and 3 to keep this \"simple\".  To do this with the suggested extension of BOUNDS:\nreal, bounds(shape(a)) :: b1\nreal, bounds(shape(a)) :: b2\nreal, bounds(shape(a)) :: b3\n\nselect rank (b1)\nrank (2)\n   select rank(b2)\n   rank (2)\n      select rank(b3)\n      rank(2)\n           b1(@:shape(b1)) = b1(@:shape(b1)) + b2(@:shape(b2)) + b2(@:shape(b3))\n      rank(3)\n           b1(@:shape(b1)) = b1(@:shape(b1)) + b2(@:shape(b2)) + b2(@:shape(b3))\n      end select\n   rank (3)\n      select rank(b3)\n      rank(2)\n           b1(@:shape(b1)) = b1(@:shape(b1)) + b2(@:shape(b2)) + b2(@:shape(b3))\n      rank(3)\n           b1(@:shape(b1)) = b1(@:shape(b1)) + b2(@:shape(b2)) + b2(@:shape(b3))\n      end select\nrank (3)\n   select rank(b2)\n   rank (2)\n      select rank(b3)\n      rank(2)\n           b1(@:shape(b1)) = b1(@:shape(b1)) + b2(@:shape(b2)) + b2(@:shape(b3))\n      rank(3)\n           b1(@:shape(b1)) = b1(@:shape(b1)) + b2(@:shape(b2)) + b2(@:shape(b3))\n      end select\n   rank (3)\n      select rank(b3)\n      rank(2)\n           b1(@:shape(b1)) = b1(@:shape(b1)) + b2(@:shape(b2)) + b2(@:shape(b3))\n      rank(3)\n           b1(@:shape(b1)) = b1(@:shape(b1)) + b2(@:shape(b2)) + b2(@:shape(b3))\n      end select\n   end select\nend select\nIt would be much better if we could somehow enable such assignment statements to be moved out of the SELECT RANK block.   Maybe if all the subscripts are multi-subscripts (i.e., those with the @) we could remove the constraint.   We would need some very solid use cases, and recognize up front that this is a big enough change that other generic capabilities in F202y may be sacrificed in the process."

Following the \"strong concepts\" idea (that we seem to agree in the generics subgroup is the way to go), if the compiler compiles this routine and does not report an error, it should mean there is no problem with this code.\nThis means that the compiler must generate the compatible ranks as part of the function signature, and then at the call site if the user passes incompatible ranks, it must generate a nice message, without having to go over the code of add to determine that.\nSo the question is, whether the compiler can generate the list of compatible ranks (in this case it seems the requirement is that they either have to have the same rank, or some of them can be scalars). If the compiler cannot do that automatically, then I think the path is to require the user to specify that explicitly using some variation of the syntax proposed by @tclune."

Experience with C++ shows that such errors can become very hard to read, as they can be nested in subroutines, etc. and the error will typically come from some line such as a = b + c that the ranks are incorrect, but the user has no idea what caused it.\n\n\nstrong concepts: the compiler reports all errors based on the function signature at the call site, without a need to go over the internal code of add. This means faster compilation (the compiler only needs to pre-compile add once, and if no errors are detected at the time of compilation of the generic add, then there are no semantic error with that code, no matter how it is called) and better error messages at the call site if the user passes incompatible array ranks in.\n\n\nAt the generic subcommittee, we currently want to do \"strong concepts\", for the advantages stated above."

If we are positioning Fortran as something better than a formula translator, we need unit testing directly built-in to the language. Currently, there are some external modules/ unit testing frameworks for that purpose (see http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Unit+testing+frameworks ), but implemented in completely different languages (Ruby, Perl, etc.), and/or with several limitations originated from the restrictions of Fortran language itself. Therefore, unit testing should be added ideally only after the implementation of \"standard library\", \"exception handling\" and m.b. after \"generic/metaprogramming\" features.",

I know there are some languages that enable, if not encourage that (Rust and maybe Python depending on the framework your using come to mind), but most languages I've used do not (Haskell, C++, Ruby, Javascript, Java, and many other's I haven't actually used).\nThe frameworks written in other languages are working around a limitation inherent in the kind of language that Fortran is, a compiled language without runtime reflection. Without that, you can't use Fortran to find the tests at run-time, you have to find them before compile time and construct a program that runs them. A sufficiently powerful preprocessor could make this doable \"in Fortran\", without having to invoke a separate tool prior to compilation, but that doesn't require any changes to the language itself (unless we want the standard to start defining prepocessor requirements too).\nDo you have an example of the kind of code and test you'd like to write, but currently can't, and what specifically the language might need in order to make it work?"

I.e., if the array argument is selected, the scalar argument wouldn't need to be evaluated.\nHowever, that still wouldn't satisfy one of the use cases (although it's not one I find particularly compelling); conditionally supplying an optional argument.

The next committee meeting is 3 weeks away (Oct 12) so I wanted to make sure we had time to discuss beforehand.\nTo recap, last time it became clear there were competing interests. I and others here and at LANL wanted an access specifier roughly in between private and public. Other committee members want something far more restrictive, something really unlike an access specifier and more analogous to the existing protected attribute for module data. This would act to really protect the data from virtually any modifications outside the module where the type was defined, and was far too restrictive to be useful for those of us who wanted an access specifier.\nThe best way forward seemed to be to tease apart these separate needs and provide tools to manage both. That way we all get what we want. This paper has specifications & syntax for protected components and protected types based on our withdrawn 20-121. If we're happy with it, I can either submit it as a paper or as a work item for the DATA subgroup.",

For our part, I wouldn't be proposing that monster feature at all (I don't see it as extremely useful personally). But when presented with protected components, the committee really wanted something extremely strong, and had lots of work towards that already. These specs derive from the work on those very restrictive protected components. It looks like if we want our more lightweight protected components, we need something strict to go with it. But we'll see as discussions develop, maybe seeing both alongside each other the committee will be willing to drop the heavy one. Hopefully the committee doesn't decide they don't see the value in our lighter protected components, deciding to go ahead with heavy-only, or decide the whole combination is more than they wanted and kill the whole concept.\n\nI'd suggest to keep the term protected for expressing read-only behaviour (of the derived type components), and use something else for defining persistent/undestroyable types (e.g. persistent).\n\nI like this, and have struggled to come up with an alternative name for \"protected type\". persistent is a good option, as it really just disables intrinsic assignment, allocation, deallocation, and automatic finalization. I'll include that along with the other name alternatives I now have at the end. I think naming will be a big point of discussion."

I contend that something that exists only in the standard after 17 years but isn't yet working correctly in any implementation or (one assumes) any production application is not really part of the language, and would not be missed if it were to be removed.\nI have several particular examples along these lines, but I would like to discuss the merits of the general principle first.  It's too easy otherwise to be distracted by \"well, I could think of a use for that\" when it comes to specific cases -- and as I describe below, there would be a means for retaining features that deserve to remain.\nMy selfish motivation, as an implementor, is a desire to avoid the wasted time and expense of supporting features that nobody will use if I do or miss if I don't.  But there might also be some benefit to users from overall simplification of the language.\nSo my specific proposal is this: Fortran 202x would contain a list of \"Possible Future Deprecations\" that enumerates usage from F'2003 and earlier that is demonstrably not implemented.  Each item would contain a minimal test program that conforms to the standard but is not capable of running anywhere.  Any item in that list that remains unimplemented as of Fortran 202Y would then become deprecated in that later standard.  This would provide a window in which pet unimplemented features could be saved from deletion by any implementor willing to demonstrate them in the meantime, or any user willing and able to force at least one vendor to do so.  And a similar list would appear in Fortran 202Y of F'2008 features not yet implemented by any compiler in its time frame.",

Both were added at the urging of single national bodies:The British for PDTs, and Germany for UDDTIO. Great Britain had two members who were focussed on language orthogonality, and thought that if the intrinsic types could specify length and kind, then so should derived types and put in a lot of effort designing this feature. They persuaded much of the rest of the UK committee to their opinion. Germany had one active member who said he would veto the standard unless it had UDDTIO, and then after it was added vetoed the F2003 standard as too complex.\nI won't speak to UDDTIO, but I have experimented a little with PDTs for bitsets. As of gfortran 10.2 PDTs for my purposes were broken. ifort was in better shape, but the restrictions on how PDTs could be used made them impractical for bitsets. Maybe Cray's compiler is in better shape.\nAs to requiring compiler implementations before adoption, good luck with that. A small part of F90 was the adoption of MIL-STD 1753, which made some common compiler extension a requirement for military compilers. Substantial parts of F77, the rest of F90, almost all of F95, and essentially all of F03 lacked prior compiler implementation. The only parts of F95 which may have had compiler implementations were FORALL, which was a failure, and the bug fixes to allocatable, which were obvious and had a TS report. F)8 and F18 did have some partial compiler experience with co-arrays, but most of the rest of the additions were a blank slate.\nThere are good reasons for that. Steve Lionel has commented elsewhere on how DEC got burned adopting an early version of PARAMETER, and now its successor, INTEL, refuses to adopt non-standardized extensions. The other commercial compilers have the same attitude. gfortran follows the piecemeal interests of its developers. FLANG/F18 has limited funding. LFortran is in a very preliminary state. Currently adopting an extension faces the following hurdles:\n\nDeveloping an extension to a language as complicated as F18 is complicated. The preliminary work required before implementation is daunting. It is difficult to justify that investment in time and money unless you are certain your users will adopt that extension. Even then it may be difficult to justify the investment.\nThe standard bodies do all of that preliminary work for \"free\", but by the time a feature has been polished enough to be implementable most of the rest of a standard (or TS report) has been finished.\nUsers are reluctant to adopt a feature unless it has been standardized."

I personally would do everything to respect the output of this long, drawn out effort that took a lot of contemplation and deliberation.  To debug (yes, a standard can have bugs too), to refine, to enhance, and to build upon the concepts and features, sure.  But to remove something in the standard starting 2003 revision, a no-no for me.  This will hold true for me for anything with 2008, 2018, and 202X revisions as well.\nAnother consideration is besides certain specific aspects of PDTs (gfortran being the exception here with a false start perhaps to its PDT implementation effort and a continued pause thereafter leading to a broken state) and perhaps miscellaneous aspects such as support for additional CHARACTER kinds e.g., toward ISO 10646 character set (which is kinda optional to processors any way), there are quite a few compilers providing rather comprehensive support for Fortran 2003.  One can credibly argue the missing aspects are either bugs due to a load of other issues (including perhaps the 'denseness' of the standardese, especially for those compiler writers who grew up outside the british 'commonwealth' locales) and a lack of a standard acceptance testing and QA/validation library or subtleties and intricacies requiring close attention that has not been demanded yet of these implementations by their customers.  With PDTs and Intel Fortran, that clearly was the case but I've been feeding them tons of test cases and they have been able to get their compiler fixed each time.\nBut now with PDTs, as I explain here, it is rather convenient and useful in design of good scientific software.  There are some use cases, particularly in the industry domain where I work, that are particularly well-suited for PDTs.  Perhaps in 20+ years if the standard with 202y and its processor implementations have sufficiently full-featured generics capabilities, PDTs may become superfluous.\nIn the meantime, considering Intel Fortran is nearly there with this feature in their attempt to serve customers like me (or more like an evangelist at this stage), deprecation of PDTs will be unconscionable.\nAdditionally, defined IO (aka UDDTIO) is a facility that is mostly a solved problem, it is implemented reasonably well in several compilers including gfortran, it is a nice-to-have feature that has proved convenient, particularly with serialization and deserialization of 'objects' in Fortran including with its NAMELIST aspect, something that helps boosts Fortran's image somewhat in terms of modernity.

Can it not suffice to use the process that led to the current standard having an incompatibility with the original F2003 such as \"Fortran 2003 permitted a sequence type to have type parameters; that is not permitted by this document\", \"Fortran 2003 permitted a statement function to be of parameterized derived type; this document does not permit that.\", etc.\nHow about starting with an Interp request first on this non-deferred type parameter issue?"

The wording for INCLUDE has \"An example of a possible valid interpretation is that char-literal-constant is the name of a file that contains the source text to be included.\" You're right that this needs to be carefully worded as to not imply a particular implementation. Indeed, some sources come from stdin or pipes. Maybe SOURCE_NAME would be a better choice. Certainly, a topic for discussion."

If that is because everyone is happy with the proposal then get it to J3 as soon as possible so non-participants in Git Hub can comment and some work can be done between meetings, even if it is not F202X work. If it is because people are tired of the issue or busy with other things then it may not be ready. As you are both the originator of the first namespace proposals, and the organizer of the Git Hub activities you have a big say as to whether it is ready.\n\nFor an F202X issue if there is a lot of activity on the GitHub forum then I would put off submitting it to J3 until about two weeks before the meeting. It means that progress is being made at the local level, and you want to make as much progress as possible before involving all of J3, but you cannot put off involving J3 until after the meeting.

For INTENT(INOUT), one typically makes the argument optional\n +to avoid the computational expense of calculating the out result, but\n +having a default value makes it awkward to determine the presence of\n +an optional argument, so the primary purpose of having it be optional\n +is defeated.\n +\n +This proposal addresses the issue for INTENT(IN), VALUE, and no intent\n +arguments that checking for the presence of the optional dummy\n +argument and using a helper variable is cumbersome and error-prone.

So I am going to list it here and hopefully you will know much better or help realize where I should submit them:\n\n\n\nCoarray slicing (equivalent of MPI_gather)\nreal :: co_Vector[*]\nreal, allocatable :: LocalVector(:)\n...\nLocalVector = co_Vector[ 1 : num_images() ]\n...\nAs far as I am aware, coarray slicing is currently not supported in Fortran 2018. This feature, however, is highly desired for writing a more concise code and potentially enabling more compiler optimization. The equivalent standard-conforming code would be:\ninteger :: i\nreal :: co_Vector[*]\nreal, allocatable :: LocalVector(:)\n...\nallocate( LocalVector(1 : num_images()) )\ndo i = 1, num_images()\n    LocalVector(i) = co_Vector[i]\nend do\n...\n\n\nthe ability to use dummy optional arguments when not present in a procedure:\nfunction runSampler(chainSize)\n    integer, intent(in), optional :: chainSize\n    if (.not.present(chainSize)) chainSize = 10000\n    ...\nThis is similar to the RFE by Curcic et al, so I won't explain it further here.\n\n\nstandardized support for a minimal healthy subset of the C/Fortran preprocessing features. preprocessors are essential for writing scalable code and many compilers are fully or partially support some level of preprocessing. C has this as part of the language. Adding preprocessors to Fortran would ensure that the community's use of preprocessors is more disciplined and supported by the language standard.\n\n\nfurther support for template metaprogramming. I know that this is already a highly popular RFE. So I just suffice to mention my strong support for it.",

            "text": "Block-structured exception handling has been provided in other languages for decades.  According to \"Programming Languages: Principles and Practice,\" 2nd edition, by Kenneth C. Louden (a notable textbook on programming languages), ``Exception handling was pioneered by the language PL/I in the 1960s and significantly advanced in CLU in the 1970s. However, it was only in the 1980s and early 1990s that design questions were largely resolved.'' Ada 83, for which development began in 1976, is probably the first language that provided block-structured exception handling in the modern form.  It is generally agreed that exception handling is commonplace in all modern languages.\nIt has been observed that the CHANGE TEAM construct described in the 6 November 2014 draft of TS 18508 (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5 paper N2033) is, in effect, an exception block, but with an intrinsic (and invisible) exception handler that only manages necessary synchronization and\ndeallocations.\nIt's time for Fortran to have a complete block-structured exception handling mechanism.  Block-structured exception handling has been proposed for Fortran, but has never been implemented.\nObjections have been raised to block-structured exception handling, usually citing performance degradation.  While some implementations of block-structured exception handling impose expense even if an exception does not occur, block-structured exception handling does not inevitably\nimpose a significant execution-time penalty if an exception does not occur.  For example, the Janus and Verdix Ada compilers' block-structured exception handling mechanisms impose very low cost if an exception does not occur, and the exception handling mechanism provided by the GNU Ada Translator (GNAT) imposes zero cost if an exception does not occur.\nThe cost of exception handling should not be confused with the cost of exception detection. An exception cannot be handled unless it is detected. Most processors have methods to specify whether certain exceptions, such as subscripts out of bounds, are detected. The cost of an exception handler is the additional cost to provide for handling an exception, if one is detected. Providing a mechanism to handle an exception does not require or imply that the processor is instructed to detect it. If the processor does detect it, the additional overhead to handle it is very\nsmall, or nonexistent, until the exception is detected. If the processor does not detect it, the additional overhead to handle an exception that cannot occur is very small, or nonexistent.\nExceptions_3.pdf",

Coders can then decide whether to make use of it and where and how in their codes just as it is with IEEE exception handling introduced in Fortran starting with the 2003 standard.\nOne of my biggest disappointments is with WG5 and how WG5 has reduced the work-list for Fortran 202X to drop items such as exception handling and generics.  Interested readers can see this link at comp,lang.fortran.  As seen in this link, many a Fortranner - with no real voice or representation due to their physical/virtual locale which is well outside the 2 to 5 country-based and rather institutionally controlled org structure - have been requesting support for exception handling but to no avail.\nThe way things function with an ISO-driven process and how arcane, archaic, and inefficient the process is when it comes to language advancement, it could very well be decades from now before the ducks get in a row for the standard process to finally work attentively toward exception handling in Fortran.  And even then there will always be the argument Fortran has survived that long without explicit exception handling support for coders, so why bother!?\nIn the meantime, there is another issue that too gets overlooked with this topic: in the industry where I work and the computing domains I am familiar with, code base after code base has moved away Fortran, a lack of support for exception handling and the demands that such a scenario places on the most important resource - developer time and productivity - is among the reasons for the flight away from Fortran.\nFor a simple example, there is a particular formula based on the pioneering scientific advancements by Gibbs and van der Waals which literally gets computed billions of times by engineers and scientists where I work.  This formula, y = f(x1, x2, .. , xN), can be written in a few lines of code and computed trivially.  Except when the values of the N independent variables x1 thru' xN are outside the physically acceptable range for practicable design and manufacturing.  The occurrence of this is truly an exceptional circumstance but which needs to be handled very carefully, for otherwise there are considerable consequences including that of safety.\nOwing to the lack of exception handling support in language, the Fortran codes were rendered exceptionally complex and verbose with developers having paid incalculable amount of attention to the handling of exceptional situations where the input values are outside the physically acceptable range.  This was so much so that a new engineer/scientist tasked to work on the code (and mostly with background in MATLAB, Python, C++, Java, .NET) would entirely fail to notice the important formula in the subprogram, it was a mind-blowing departure from the concept of Formula Translation and black-board abstraction.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the computations involving this formula are now performed in any number of compute environments where Fortran plays little to no role.  The code written in other languages is rather compact, readable and maintainable, albeit full of curly braces!!  For the purse-holders and budget managers though, the new code is overall better performant in spite of the use of structured exception handling.  So they can't be happier with their push away from Fortran.\nThis is an aspect where implementations such as LFortran, LLVM, etc. can be of great help with prototyping."

However, no matter who gets selected in the end, let us work on these things, and when they are ready, I will bring them to the Committee to consider.\nSo let's get to work.\nThere are several approaches to exception handling. The above proposal is one. Here are other issues with other proposals: #6, #66. There are more.\nUltimately, this must be prototyped in a compiler to show that there is no performance overhead, and also to iron out corner cases, and to see how difficult it is to implement it. We will be able to do such prototypes very soon (if things go well, hopefully in a year or so). Until then, let's at least narrow down the options of what ideas should be prototyped.\nAlso, let's collect the most common objections and have solid answers to them. Here are some off top of my head:\n\nWhat are the performance implications?\nWhy are many C++ applications turning off exceptions for performance (in gaming industry for example)?\nThe C++ committee does not seem to be super happy with their traditional exceptions, and are proposing a different mechanism: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0709r0.pdf; Wouldn't it be a mistake to do what C++ found is not such a great idea?\n\nAnd there is a lot more, see the thread at the J3 mailinglist starting with this email:\nhttps://mailman.j3-fortran.org/pipermail/j3/2019-February/011256.html\nWe have to collect all the objections there and have a good answer, before we bring it back to the committee. Otherwise the same objections will be given and we will not move the discussion forward.\nThis is the real work that we have to do. I currently don't have time to drive this particular effort, but if somebody is interested in leading this, I will help as much as I can."

Your proposal disallows calling the fallible subroutine outside of an error handling context, which is very explicit and will cause all errors to be explicitly handled, which I think is a nice feature.\nTwo questions:\n\n\nHow would this be implemented in the compiler? Would there be an implicit additional intent(out) argument __failed for every subroutine that is fallible? And then an implicit if statement right after calling any fallible subroutine that will check this __failed argument and if it is .true., it would immediately return and propagate __failed to the parent subroutine or main program?\n\n\nAssume you are in the main program or in some non-fallible subroutine. And you need to call a subroutine that is fallible, but you don't want to be handling errors, you just want the program to fail at runtime with a stacktrace, just like currently allocate will fail if you don't set the stat argument. In your proposal currently you have to do:\n\n\ntry\n    call mysum(5, s)\ncatch default\n    error stop\nend try\nWhich is quite verbose given that you don't want to handle the error. Would it make sense to create a shortcut for the above code as follows:\ntry mysum(5, s)\nWhich would be exactly equivalent to the above code. So in practice, if you have an existing code that has call mysum(5, s) and then later if the mysum subroutine becomes fallible, but you don't care about handling the error, all you have to do is to change call into try at each call site. Which is a simple change and the compiler would tell you which places need changing, and you can decide at each place if you want the default handling (error stop + stacktrace at runtime) or if you want to handle the error yourself. And also even later on, you will always see which places in your code can fail using the default error handling (error stop) and change them to handle the possible failure yourself. So that seems like a robust design."

However, no matter who gets selected in the end, let us work on these things, and when they are ready, I will bring them to the Committee to consider.\nSo let's get to work.\n..\n\nThe C++ committee does not seem to be super happy with their traditional exceptions, and are proposing a different mechanism: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0709r0.pdf; Wouldn't it be a mistake to do what C++ found is not such a great idea?\n..\n\n\nThank you @certik , your feedback and suggestions are very inclusive of the broader needs of the community and as such, they are very helpful to achieve progress in the Fortran language with this important feature.\nAs I mentioned above, my experience in industry is along the same lines as the IEEE Spectrum ranking in terms of the popular languages employed for computing and where each and every one of the top languages offers support for exception handling.  In addition to C++, the languages used and all of whom support exception handling include C# and Java and Python and R and also some new languages such as Swift which has gained a lot of influence due to the influence of iOS ecosystem: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html.  But not to be overlooked are other recent languages such as Julia which do compete with C++ and Fortran in the high-performance computing space also e.g., https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/control-flow/#Exception-Handling-1.  And as mentioned by @vansnyder, Ada with its focus on embedded devices and controls and task-based concurrent programming with highly demanding environments such as aircraft systems has also provided robust support for exception handling.\nThus it appears many paths are available beyond that taken by early C++and I hope Fortran can also quickly learn from other approaches such as Julia, Swift, C#, etc. and offer up some performant facility."

So then, how does one either put the \"performance\" issue to bed once and for all, or illustrate what can work with Fortran and what semantics to avoid?\nSeparately, I think syntax is the easier part though the debates might get \"passionate\" and agreement on the terms may prove elusive.  Does one go with verbs that are similar in sound and meaning as most other popular languages in scientific and technical programming and which will make it easier for younger Fortranners to relate to and employ the facility e.g., try, throw/throws, catch, defer, etc?  Or does Fortran end up with terms that are deliberately intended to make it stand apart and even sound archaic (\"classic\" in some minds) such as enable, raise, handle, fallible/fall and so forth.\nHowever there are a couple of big bridges to cross before Fortran can arrive at the \"world of fun\" with syntax.\nHow does one get started?\n@certik, with your vision toward WG5, would more liberal and robust use of the \"Technical Specification (TS)\" approach be worth a consideration to push progress on certain long-standing but dormant items such as exception handling?"

By development, I mean by other library writers who want to roll out their own containers for others to use e.g., FOSS minded, commercial entities, etc."

Keeping in mind Fortran does not have a concept of NAMESPACEs but the language standard does have a concept of a scoping unit, a thought I have had for a while is whether a prefix-spec (a la PURE for procedures) can be introduced into the language  which signals to the processor a scoping unit will not use any of the language keyword as a name for any of the entities (derived type names, named constants, variables, dummy arguments, etc.) in that scoping unit and also in any nested scoping units in that scope!\nPossible names for this new prefix-spec are PURE, or SIMPLE, or CLEAN, or NEAT, etc.\nFor example, MODULEs and SUBMODULEs are scoping units as is a main program, or an external subprogram, or an interface body, a derived type definition, a BLOCK construct, etc.\nSay the language allowed\nPURE module foo_m  !<-- Suggested new prefix-spec\n   use ..\n   ..\n   <some_type>, parameter :: ..\n   type :: t\n     ..\n   end type\n   interface ..\n     ..\n   end interface\n   ..\ncontains\n   subroutine ..\n      ..\n   end subroutine ..\n   ..\n   function ..\n      ..\n   end function ..\n   ..\nend module ..\nAnd this were to inform the processor the above scoping unit cannot have a name clash in any entity in that scope with any of the keywords in the language, as listed by @certik above, then I think it provides a way to enforce a good coding practice (GCP) while also enabling better/faster tooling with such \"clean\" codes in Fortran.\nJust a thought,"

If one changes parameterx to parametex, then it compiles. One can probably find other such examples.\nFinally, I should mention that people have asked me why we cannot make keywords reserved in Fortran that it would simplify a lot of things. So this is not some academic exercise. The community asked us, and I see it as our job to have a good answer plus associated discussion why this cannot be done (if that is the case)."

            "text": "@zjibben and I would like to summarize this in the README, so that we are all on the same page what the process is.\nIn fact, there seems to be a little disagreement how new features should be developed at the Committee. Some members of the Committee prefer to start with writing down requirements, pass it. Then develop specification (specs) based on the requirements. Pass it. Then develop syntax, pass it. And finally edits to the standard and pass it. 4 papers.\n@zjibben and I think we should instead use the following approach, which is similar, but different:\n\n\nProposal: Develop a proposal that discusses use cases both before and after the feature. It discusses syntax and how the new feature should be used. The proposal does not have to have all the details fleshed out, but it needs to be clear to the reader what the feature should be and it concentrates on syntax and properties of the new feature.\n\n\nRequirements: From the Proposal, extract Requirements.\n\n\nSpecification: From the Requirements only, logically derive Specification.\n\n\nSyntax: From the Specification, logically derive and propose Syntax.\n\n\nIterate: Does 3. and 4. agree with the Proposal at 1. ? If it does not, then we need to iterate the process 1. - 4. until it agrees and is self consistent.\n\n\nEdits: Write Edits to the standard.\n\n\nThe advantage of this approach 1. - 6. is that it ensures both:\na) The feature is what the community wants (this is ensured by 1.)\nb) The feature is the best way to achieve something, i.e., there is not an alternate way to develop a feature (this is ensured by extracting the abstract requirements in 2. and then ensuring that the feature in 3. and 4. logically follows from it, and that it agrees with 1., as ensured in 5.)\nOn the other hand, by starting with Requirements right away, we ensure consistent feature, but we cannot ensure we end up with a feature that the community wants. In fact, by observing how features get developed at the Committee, very often we see features that are not what the community wants, because 1. was skipped, and we went straight to 2.\nExample:\nAn example proposal that got recently passed by the Committee that follows this process is #161, where:\n1: https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/18/18-273r1.txt\n2, 3, 4: https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/19/19-201r1.txt\n5: In this case 3. and 4. agree with 1.\n6: https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/20/20-116.txt\ncc @FortranFan.",

Has the effect of TRIM on the corresponding character list item before output.\nUS11 - Control over leading zeros in output of REAL values.\nUS12 - Allow an array of a type that has an allocatable coarray component.\n#20 US13 - Syntax and semantics for a \"Put with Notify\" operation.\n#160 US14 - Allow deferred-length character variables in more locations, including as actual arguments corresponding to IOMSG and ERRMSG arguments for similar variables in specifiers.  Also allow for internal I/O.\n#161 US15 - SIMPLE procedures. A form of Super-Pure that disallows references to global data.\n#158 US16 - TYPEOF and CLASSOF type declarations to indicate the object being declared has the same type/class as another object. Useful to ensure a local variable in a procedure has the same type as a dummy argument, or that two dummy arguments have the same type.\n#157 US17 - Syntax to specify an element or section of an array with arbitrary rank.\n#157 US18 - Syntax for generic specification of rank and bounds of an object.\n#156 #16 US19 - Protected components.\n#17 US20 - Reduction specifier for DO CONCURRENT.\n#11 US21 - Typed enumerators.\n#183 US22 - Conditional expressions. (alternatively: #19 US26 - Short-circuit logical operators.)\n#18 US23 - Enhancements to BOZ constants.\n#5 US27 - Syntax to specify that the target of a dummy argument pointer is not to be changed (INTENT applies to the pointer, not its target)\n\nThe list is described in the document N2165 US Feature list proposals for F202X (PL22.3) as available from https://wg5-fortran.org/documents.html, but unfortunately the link is dead. We also found the list in the minutes N2169 Minutes of the August 2019 Meeting in Tokyo available from https://wg5-fortran.org/f202x.html. Just in case, I am attaching the N2169 document to this issue, so that it does not get lost.\nOnce all such ideas are fully developed and passed by the J3 and WG5 Committees, then the 202X standard will get out, and we will work on 202Y.\nIn order to speed up the 202X release as well as to ensure that the community agrees with the proposals that the committee passes, I encourage wide community participation in the proposals for these features.\nISO-IECJTC1-SC22-WG5_N2169_Minutes_of_the_August_2019_Meeting_in_Tokyo.txt",

So I am going to list it here and hopefully you will know much better or help realize where I should submit them:\n\n\nCoarray slicing (equivalent of MPI_gather)\nreal :: co_Vector[*]\nreal, allocatable :: LocalVector(:)\n...\nLocalVector = co_Vector[ 1 : num_images() ]\n...\nAs far as I am aware, coarray slicing is currently not supported in Fortran 2018. This feature, however, is highly desired for writing a more concise code and potentially enabling more compiler optimization. The equivalent standard-conforming code would be:\ninteger :: i\nreal :: co_Vector[*]\nreal, allocatable :: LocalVector(:)\n...\nallocate( LocalVector(1 : num_images()) )\ndo i = 1, num_images()\n    LocalVector(i) = co_Vector[i]\nend do\n...\n\n\nthe ability to use dummy optional arguments when not present in a procedure:\nfunction runSampler(chainSize)\n    integer, intent(in), optional :: chainSize\n    if (.not.present(chainSize)) chainSize = 10000\n    ...\nThis is similar to the RFE by Curcic et al, so I won't explain it further here.\n\n\nstandardized support for a minimal healthy subset of the C/Fortran preprocessing features. preprocessors are essential for writing scalable code and many compilers are fully or partially support some level of preprocessing. C has this as part of the language. Adding preprocessors to Fortran would ensure that the community's use of preprocessors is more disciplined and supported by the language standard.\n\n\nfurther support for template metaprogramming. I know that this is already a highly popular RFE. So I just suffice to mention my strong support for it."

If using the equivalence of = being \"copy constructor in C++\", allocate being \"constructor\" and \"deallocate\" being \"destructor\", those in C++ can be implicitly generated by the compiler, or written explicitly by the user, in either case they are methods of the object itself, and thus if C++ had protected components, it seems that one could call = and create and destruct the object.

In particular, if you have a type with a protected component (or some subobject which ultimately has a protected component), there are many things you wouldn't be able to do outside the module where it is defined. The restrictions which raised concern were, outside the module where the type containing a protected component defined, you could not allocate or deallocate a variable of the type, nor use intrinsic assignment to the object as a whole if it contains a protected data member (a = b is disallowed if b%c is protected). It also restricted type extension, so one could never have an extension type with a protected component if the parent didn't also have a protected component (this restriction would prevent a loophole to get around the no-intrinsic-assignment rule above).\nSome committee members were concerned this would make protected components too unwieldy to use in practice, that they shouldn't add more write-restrictions than private components, and protected components shouldn't have so strong an affect on how the object itself is used. They would force a lot of boiler plate to use defined assignment or type extension or allocatables if all a programmer wanted was automatic and free getter methods. On the other hand, the counter-argument is that without these restrictions you aren't really protecting the data all that much. Anyone outside the module could blow it away with a reallocation or intrinsic assignment to the variable which ultimately contains protected data.\nWe agreed the restriction on type extension was too far, so that is going away. The rest is up for debate. At the moment things are leaning toward reworking the requirements entirely, that the original version may be too heavy a hammer, but I think nothing is really settled one way or another."

I sat down with them to write up a toy example to depict what I (and I think others here) would like, which includes intrinsic assignment for one.

We want to be able to do this.\n\n  ! Now it is not possible to insert garbage in f%a,\n  ! without changing f%b\n\nend program main\nThe counter-example which shows the danger they're concerned about is here, using a linked list:\n! Linked list mock-up\nmodule bar_type\n\n  implicit none\n\n  type :: bar\n    type(bar), pointer, protected :: prev => null()\n    type(bar), pointer, protected :: next => null()\n  contains\n    procedure :: init\n  end type bar\n\ncontains\n\n  subroutine init(this)\n\n    class(bar), intent(out) :: this\n\n    this%prev => this\n    this%next => this\n\n  end subroutine init\n\nend module bar_type\n\n\nprogram main\n\n  use bar_type\n  implicit none\n\n  type(bar) :: f, g\n\n  call g%init()\n\n  f = g\n  ! Now f has pointers to g instead of itself, so is a\n  ! linked list that can't get back to itself.\n  ! Committee solution is forbid intrinsic assignment.\n\nend program main\nThe argument coming from some in the committee is that intrinsic assignment can produce things you don't want, so why do it? If you want assignment, make a defined assignment within the module where the type is defined. I might argue that this danger seems limited to linked-list type situations and not particularly damaging (existing data is intact, new object is undesired). So, we might instead have a programmer write defined assignment to override (=) when they want to prevent intrinsic assignment rather than make it impossible for all the objects where it's actually preferred. But at this point I believe we are at an impasse of conflicting interests, and most likely the \"forbid intrinsic assignment, allocation, and deallocation\" version will go through."

Anyway, if some more arguments are needed: I think, the case of the linked list structure, which was used to justify the complicated behavior, is not a very good one. Usually, if one implements a container, one wants to hide the implementation details (whether it is a linked list or not) completely and provides iterators instead. So trying to make a linked list safe from unnoticed changes should not the object to aim for. What we should aim at instead is to protect consistency of data within one derive type instance without any kind of warranty for the \"ethernal\" existence of the derived type instance. (Exactly as the language already does it for private components...)\nAs a compromise, why not splitting the efforts into two parts?\n\nFirst, introducing the lightweight protected attribute. As already discussed, it should behave like private apart of the readability from outside, and would have basically no side-effects. It would be symmetric to how protected already works for module, where it exactly behaves as private with the additional readability from outside. This could be basically introduced immediately into the language.\nInterested people could work on the introduction of a more protective keyword (e.g. immutable), which could do all the hard protection with all the horrible side effects, and see, whether they come up with something which still can be used.\n\nAnd one last note, as pointers were mentioned: A pointer having the protected attribute should be protected the same way, as a pointer dummy argument with the intent(in) attribute would be protected in a subroutine: That means, only the pointer instance would be protected, but not necessarily the content it points to. Again, this maybe unsatisfactory, but would be IMHO much more consistent with the current language, as the one suggested by the committee members.\nAnyway @certik @zjibben thanks a lot for all your efforts, and let's see, whether we still  have to provide getters in twenty years...."

Nothing useful I can add at this stage.\nHowever I am simply unable to understand the protected type, the rationale for it, its use cases, and the accompanying requirements and the specifications.\nThus an immediate question and a suggestion: will it be possible to break up the protected components and protected types into two separate work items with the committee and which can then have separate papers to develop the features?  This way, if one aspect, say protected components, looks mature, it can advance without being held back by the other,"

            "text": "The implementation of first the generic statistical functions in stdlib exposed the lack of a general array indexing infrastructure of Fortran. For example, in the experimental implementation of a generic mean() function one has to generate a separate function for each possible rank. It would be nice, if Fortran offered an infrastructure which makes the generation of this vast amount of routines unnecessary. Let's collect in this issue, what we would need for that:\nI my opinion, we lack following features for the moment:\n\nPossibility for a function to return an array with a rank unknown at compile time (the array should not be necessary an allocatable one!)\nGeneral indexing scheme, which allows accessing arrays / strides / slices in an array without the usual comma-separated index notation. (Funny enough, the Fortran 2018 C-interoperability makes that possible, but only in C! It would be nice, if he had similar tools in Fortran!)\n\nAs a proof of concept, let's require functionality which enables to write a function, which just wraps the sum() intrinsic (taken from #144).\nmodule test\n  implicit none\n\ncontains\n\n  function sum_wrapper(array, dim) result(redarray)\n    real, dimension(..), intent(in) :: array\n    integer, intent(in) :: dim\n    ! Dimension would be an array of \"slice-types\" allowing dynamic\n    ! determination of the shape of the returned array\n    real, dimension(get_redarray_shape(array, dim)) :: redarray\n\n    redarray(get_redarray_shape(array, dim)) = sum(array, dim=dim)\n\n  end function sum_wrapper\n\n\n  pure function get_redarray_shape(array, dim) result(redshape)\n    real, dimension(..), intent(in) :: array\n    integer, intent(in) :: dim\n    type(slice), dimension(rank(array) - 1) :: redshape\n    integer :: ii\n\n    do ii = 1, dim - 1\n      ! With the intrinsic function get_slices, we should get access to the\n      ! slicing parameters of the array (similar, how you can do it in C since\n      ! Fortran 2018)\n      redshape(ii) = get_slices(array, dim=ii)\n    end do\n    do ii = dim + 1, rank(array)\n      redshape(ii - 1) = get_slices(array, dim=ii)\n    end do\n\n  end function get_redarray_shape\n\nend module test\n\nHaving functionality along those lines (eventually combined with the one described in #144) would enable to write rank-agnostic general functions, on par with the intrinsic sum() and product() functions.",

            "title": "Finalization order for complex objects: official interpretation needed?",
            "text": "@certik asked that I share this here.\nI've encountered an issue with finalization that is illustrated by the example that follows. There is a parent type and child type that extends the parent, each with a final subroutine. The child type has two derived type components, one allocatable, the other not. The component types also have final subroutines.  The point of the example is to reveal the order in which the final subroutines are called.\nTwo compilers produce the results I expected, namely the string \"CABP\" for Child, component A, component B, and Parent.  \"CBAP\" would have been equally acceptable.  A third compiler produces the string \"CBPA\".  The preliminary response from the vendor of the latter compiler is that the standard is ambiguous with conflicting requirements and that choice of behavior is arguably valid. They did go into some explanation, but I haven't yet understood their argument. I'll be following up with them, and as I understand more I'll comment here with it. Section 7.5.6.2 (2018) seems pretty clear to me (arguing for \"CABP\") but there may well be other parts of the standard that are inconsistent with it -- I have a lot of respect for this vendor. If an official interpretation and standard clarification is required I would strongly urge for \"CABP\".\n[Edit] The core question here is why does the third compiler vendor believe the allocatable component A have to be finalized last after the parent, whereas the non-allocatable component B should be finalized before the parent.\nHere is the example\nmodule child_type\n\n  implicit none\n  private\n\n  type :: objectA\n  contains\n    final :: finalize_objectA\n  end type\n\n  type :: objectB\n  contains\n    final :: finalize_objectB\n  end type\n\n  type :: parent\n  contains\n    final :: finalize_parent\n  end type\n\n  type, extends(parent), public :: child\n    type(objectA), allocatable :: A\n    type(objectB) :: B\n  contains\n    procedure :: init\n    final :: finalize_child\n  end type\n\ncontains\n\n  subroutine finalize_objectA(this)\n    type(objectA), intent(inout) :: this\n    write(*,'(\"A\")',advance='no')\n  end subroutine\n\n  subroutine finalize_objectB(this)\n    type(objectB), intent(inout) :: this\n    write(*,'(\"B\")',advance='no')\n  end subroutine\n\n  subroutine finalize_parent(this)\n    type(parent), intent(inout) :: this\n    write(*,'(\"P\")',advance='no')\n  end subroutine\n\n  subroutine finalize_child(this)\n    type(child), intent(inout) :: this\n    write(*,'(\"C\")',advance='no')\n  end subroutine\n\n  subroutine init(this)\n    class(child), intent(inout) :: this\n    allocate(this%A)\n  end subroutine\n\nend module\n\nprogram main\n  use child_type\n  call run\ncontains\n  subroutine run\n    type(child) :: c\n    call c%init\n  end subroutine\nend program",

                    "text": "A bit of background for those who might be wondering. In the actual use case, the child type is a \"solver\". The solver makes use of a third party framework library AMReX that the solver starts up as part of its initialization and then shuts down when the solver is deallocated or goes out of scope. The solver also has components that have framework objects as subobjects.  These must be finalized before the framework is shutdown. In order to ensure that things happen in the right order, the solver extends a dummy parent type whose main purpose is to shut down the framework as part of the parent's final subroutine. Unfortunately this doesn't work with the way the third compiler behaves.\nIn the actual use case the allocatable component is polymorphic (hence making it non-allocatable isn't an option), but that is an extraneous feature to the core question. Interestingly, one of the compilers that gets the example \"right\" totally blows it for the allocatable polymorphic component case -- it never bothers to call its finalizer at all."

In particular, the parent component absolutely may not be finalized in step (3) until after the non-parent components have been finalized in step (2) (see 7.5.6.2).\nThe child's final procedure can effectively force the order \"ACBP\" if necessary by deallocating A in finalize_child before doing anything else."

Unfortunately, I think the (unintended?) consequence is that all three output---\"CBAP\", \"CABP\", and \"CBPA\"--- would be legal and is processor dependent.\nI think \"CBPA\" is, at least, very counter-intuitive to users and should not be allowed, although at the moment I can't come up with a good technical reason for why it should not be allowed.

The rationale appears to again come back to the major role played by backwards compatibility (#79) in Fortran, this time with the semantics of auto-deallocation of ALLOCATABLEs whose introduction preceded by well over a decade that of the finalization facility.  To allow 'CBPA' appears to have consequences with ALLOCATABLEs.\nALLOCATABLEs is among the most valuable features in the language and Fortran is rather unique in providing such support intrinsically..  This allows programmers to get closer to formula translation rather than deal with memory management, GC (garbage collection), etc. in the codes toward scientific and technical computing.\nGiven the use case provided by OP in #146 (comment) with AMReX, implementing a finalizer for the case at hand appears a safe approach regardless of the language standard.  And which then would avoid the concerns with this particular situation."

He does a nice job of explaining how allocatables and finalization evolved separately and how we arrived at the state things are today. It also explains how some compilers have arrived at implementing Strategy One, including presumably NAG's, and that the goal of his proposed interp is to preserve such implementations. However as a user looking from the outside, that internal implementation detail carries little weight with me.  To me the fundamental question is does it make sense for A to be finalized after P, and in particular does it make sense for A to be finalized after P when its sibling component B is finalized before merely because one is allocatable and one is not.  I find that behavior to be very surprising and at odds with C++, for example, and I would imagine other OO languages.\nYou specifically called out allocatable.  I wholeheartedly agree about their value, but I don't see that an alternative interp that would reject the CBPA order (implemented using Malcolm's Strategy Two perhaps) would need to do anything whatsoever to damage them or change their semantics. Am I mistaken there? Nor would it break code that used to be unambiguously valid; this is not a backwards compatibility question that I can see.\nPerhaps I overlooked something in Malcolm's analysis that you think should sway my opinion; if so, please point it out to me."

We don't want users to move to C++, we want to keep them in Fortran. Allowing CBPA would hurt the cause here. I am sure @nncarlson is not the only one that got surprised by it."

Changing the A component to \u201cCLASS(*)\u201d and the allocation to allocate it as type OBJECTA, the two CBPA-producing compilers remain producing CBPA (as one might expect if they\u2019re following the deallocation-causes-finalization model), but one of the other two now produces CBP which is clearly erroneous.\nI am not necessarily opposed in principle to the idea of changing finalization to cause deallocation of allocatable components, though it seems to me that the user already has the tools available to force an ordering when he wants to, so I am yet to be convinced of its usefulness. I do however, think this would be a significant change to the design (virtually a new feature), and so should be considered (should we decide that it is in fact desirable) in a future revision."

The reason\nis that a named abstract interface would be viewed as a type in its own right, and the meaning\nof say the declaration\ntrait(ISolver), allocatable :: solver\nis that solver is to be treated like a (polymorphic) variable of type ISolver. Fortran is needlessly verbose here. In Java the above would simply be written as follows:\nISolver solver;\nSo, in this notation, your above example would be\nISolver, IPrinter client;\nwhich I am pretty sure Java doesn't allow because it views it as a self-contradiction (as the variable can only have one declared type).\n\n\nConcerning the declaration of the variable self within the IShowable interface of your second example: I think this variable must be declared as being an instance of the derived type my_type, rather than being of type IShowable. The reasoning being that the function show is a procedure that is bound to my_type, and would thus need to have, in general, access to my_type's data fields, in order to do some useful work. But data fields are forbidden for interfaces.\n\n\nSo, your example of IShowable's declaration would have to read something like this\nabstract interface :: IShowable\n    import :: my_type\n    function show(self) result(string)\n        type(my_type), intent(in) :: self\n        character(len=:), allocatable :: string\n    end function show\nend interface IShowable\n\ntype, implements(IShowable) :: my_type\n...\ncontains\n    procedure :: show => my_type_show\nend type my_type\n\n\nwhich brings us to the next point: this is a nasty circular reference (IShowable depends on my_type, while my_type depends on IShowable) that would need to be dealt with somehow.\nI personally believe that it will be essentially impossible, in any OO application code of some complexity, to entirely avoid circular references. But we want their occurrence to be among interfaces only. We don't want them to occur among concrete implementation types, and we sure don't want them to occur between interfaces and types that depend on them.\nUnless I am missing something, I believe we need to check in detail how this has been dealt with in Rust."

Probably.\nBut what about abstract and extended types? If I create an abstract type that \"implements\" a trait, but defers implementation of some of the procedures, in the extended type, when implementing the necessary procedures, do arguments of type(ITrait) refer to the parent type or the child type? Probably the child type.\nI think we can probably define the spec well enough to handle this, just trying to make sure we think through all the edge cases."

It seems the way Rust handles Traits is something to consider, it might be exactly what we need. We discussed that the Rust syntax seems identical for compile time as well as runtime generics, and we were a bit unsure how Rust determines which one will happen. We should do more examples and analyze on case by case basis.\nMore importantly, when considering features such as #157, a common objection at the plenary was that we really need to have a plan for generics (even if they would go into 202Y) so that we can ensure that such features such as #157 are designed to be consistent with generics, so that we do not end up with a not well thought out system.\nAs such, I would like to push forward and hopefully get a community agreement how the generics should be done for 202Y, and then design features such as #157 for 202X to be consistent with them."

Tab characters are very commonly used, however, to separate fields - for instance in CSV files. It would be nice if a tab character would be treated in the same way as a comma/semicolon.\nMore specifically: a single tab separates two fields (numerical or character or ..), two consecutive tabs separate an empty position and the corresponding variable in the READ statement would not be changed, just as with two consecutive commas. In fact, the treatment of a tab should be exactly the same as a comma (or semicolon).\nThis will introduce a backward incompatibility., To avoid that, the OPEN statement could be used in the same way as the keyword DECIMAL changes the meaning of a comma to attach this meaning to the tab character. Something along the lines of:\nOPEN( NEWUNIT=lun, FILE='input.csv', TAB='SEPARATOR' )\nAlternatively: TAB='CHARACTER' to indicate no special treatment of tab characters should be applied.

A possible problem with this is accommodating different character KINDs, so this might be limited to  input records that only contain default kind characters.\nREAD(..., SEPARATORS=\", ;\\t\"), where \"\\t\" is not what the user would type, a real TAB character (of default kind) would be what the user would type.  Only affects list directed input of records containing solely default kind characters.\n\n\nif a blank is included in the SEPARATORS value, what do consecutive blanks do?  Perhaps blanks should always be a separator?\n\n\ndoes a SEPARATORS character in a delimited (or non-delimited) character input value affect anything?  Probably not, that is, its not a separator if in a delimited character string in an input record.\n\n\nperhaps this capability should only add new separators, not affect blank, comma, semicolon, and possibly be limited to control characters (not a well defined thing in the standard), or non-alphanumeric, not .+='\"()*&%$#@! etc???

After reading Brad's comment here, I also struggled thinking of a good use case for a default value of an intent(out) until I saw Jeremie's example with the open() function. A more general form of this example could be the use case of return codes for exception handling (many many projects use this style of exception handling):\nsubroutine simulate(a, rc)\n  real, intent(in) :: a\n  integer, intent(out), optional :: rc = 0 ! assume success\n  ... ! simulation code\n  if (present(rc)) then\n    ! test for simulation state\n    if (some_erroneous_condition) then\n      rc = 173 ! meaningful error code\n      return\n    end if\n  end if\n  ... ! more simulation code\nend subroutine simulate\nThe only aspect that the default initializer helps here with is that we don't have to have a separate line at the top: rc = 0 ! assume success. So it seems to me that in the case of intent(out), setting default value really only acts as an initializer (which doesn't imply save!), which is minor, but can still be useful.\nAnother technical argument for allowing default value for any intent is that the rule is easier to explain, write, and implement (no special cases)."

At present (!), \"presentness\" is passed on to other routines where the dummy is optional.\nTo me, this is awfully complicated and performance-inhibiting. I foresee a lot of opposition to such a thing. I still favor default values being supplied by the caller, in which case everything falls out without adding a layer of complexity. It is also far easier to explain (and implement.)\nIn my experience, I have not seen default values combined with \"did the caller really pass something?\" This is not to say that there couldn't be a case for that, but it isn't compelling to me."

I also tried doing it with pointers to eliminate some of the problems with having to declare a local variable, which #22 would eliminate.\nSo I would say #22 would work great; there are still a few places not concerned with optional arguments where it is a pain to deal with the lengths being equal, but essentially you are right - I would prefer \"22\" to be implemented instead of this if the choice were between the two. And I have not seen nearly the activity for this as for \"22\"; so if I am the only one that wants this it can be dropped (as I have a work-around)."

There is no standard way to reopen the preattached files connected to stdin and stdout as streams to support generating such applications.  Non-advancing I/O does not solve the problem primarily because of there being a limit on line length and for other well-documented reasons.\nCalling the C routines via the ISO_C_BINDING interface is the work-around I have  seen used the most.  If possible, an OPEN on the pre-attached files that allowed changing them to STREAM I/O and optionally binary seems like it would be the nicest syntax.  Although far less preferred by  myself even new  intrinsics like GETC() and PUTC() that mirrored the C functions of the same name\nwould be better than the current state.  Note that in some programming environments you can do an INQUIRE() on the units and close and reopen them, but not on others.  And there is the complication that you can usually only do that for the units defined by\nuse, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : stdin=>input_unit, stdout=>output_unit, stderr=>error_unit\nand not necessarily the ones representing by \"*\".   Not having this as a standard capability greatly limits the construction of filters using Fortran.",

Fortran 202X is \"closed\" for instance.\nMy first thought when I read the original post is the phrase, \"but shall not contain embedded blanks,\" appears entirely questionable for a language that not only allows blanks in many contexts (e.g., x % n = 42 but which requires any and all including new processors to continue to support fixed-form source with its \"semantics\" toward \"embedded blanks\".

But I believe that x % a = 1 would be a valid Fortran statement.  Other spacings like x %a = 1 fail because it rejects %a as a valid variable, again due to space-delimiters.\nMy guess is that v(1, 1) = 5 only works because the (, ) are acting as delimiters of a subsection of the designator.  Something like x % a has no delimiters, and I can see how it may be a challenge (maybe impossible?) to parse correctly.\nI now see some purpose in the current wording, and I no longer think it's just a simple matter of relaxing the zero-blanks requirement of the designators."

I'm only suggesting that the problem is more complicated than my original example suggests and probably needs more discussion.\nAnd there's the problem that it is not parseable by a greater number of compilers, so I can't simply say \"nearly everyone supports this already\".  My x % a = 1 example above fails on GCC, for example.\nFortran source has the luxury of having \\n as a delimiter between statements and can usually treat spaces as null characters, whereas namelists must treat both as potential delimiters.  So at the least one cannot expect all of the Fortran rules to carry over on default.\nFor example, these are valid namelists which would not be valid Fortran statements:\n&test1\n    x\n    =\n    1\n/\n\n&test2 x=1 y=2 /"

Unlike source, list-directed and NAMELIST reads are perfectly capable of spanning record boundaries, as long as the input item is requesting more data.\nThe standard says, for free-form source, that a \"token\" cannot have embedded blanks. In the case of x%a, each of x, % and a are tokens, and the input processor is perfectly capable of handling this in an unambiguous fashion, if so implemented, even split across record boundaries. Once an identifier is seen (x here), it has to keep looking until it sees a =.\nAs I noted earlier, I think it would be adequate to say that tokens in the designator may not have embedded blanks, adopting the language the standard has for free-form source:\n\nIn free source form blank characters shall not appear within lexical tokens other than in a character context or in a format specification. Blanks may be inserted freely between tokens to improve readability; for example, blanks may occur between the tokens that form a complex literal constant.

Blanks may be inserted freely between tokens to improve readability.\"  I've a really hard time believing how such an improved facility can be any difficult for a present-day parser or a processor.\nTaking it to the level of \"whitespace\", a term currently unknown to the Fortran standard and which some may understand as implying more than blanks, perhaps tab characters, newline, carriage return, form feed, etc. may be \"nice to have\" - I don't know yet and which I'll defer.\nBut I'll be happy if last sentence in paragraph 2 of 13.11.2 Name-value subsequences under 13.11 Namelist formatting were to read:\n\n\"Each designator may be preceded and followed by one or more optional blanks but any lexical token within a designator shall not contain embedded blanks\"."

It may prove rather difficult to get much excitement and support to make NAMELIST output more functional.\nSince the use case suggests the need with \"large arrays\", an alternative for coders might be to consider an OO approach and design 'classes' aka derived types to encapsulate such large arrays e.g., a roll-your-own derived type in Fortran to model something like 'vector' class from C++ STL as a container for the 'large' array.  Users can then implement derived-type IO (DTIO) that includes NAMELIST support to output (and input) process the array section data in a variety of flexible ways.

Other compilers (recursive descent with backtracking) normalize the source, dealing with line continuation and INCLUDE and preprocessing along the way, without knowledge of the partial parse.\nThese proposals that mess with line continuation rules would be hard to implement in both of these kinds of compilers -- those with tokenization steps that handle line continuation will need more state from the parser to handle the implicit continuation, and those that normalize the source stream before beginning any parsing will have to track things like parenthesis/bracket nesting and dangling = signs while making line continuation decisions.

That is, support those wanting explicit typed declarations (as is the case now) but also allow type inferencing.\nConsider for example, the development of a 'modern' process simulator of chemical manufacturing facilities costing $$ billions with extensive handling of massive amounts of data in addition to intensive numerical computations: languages supporting features such as the ones introduced in C++ starting their C++11 revision thru' C++14, C++17, and soon C++20 (including with type inference and auto are going to preferred by majority of the developers because these developers then find it easier to rapidly put together functional codes for a lot of the component and libraries which are both critical and reused extensively across the application.

I use auto for complicated iterators, as that simplifies the code a lot (e.g., in \"for auto\"). But otherwise whenever I can, I try to list the type explicitly, because it makes the code a lot more readable --- the reader can immediately see the types of everything. With auto everywhere, the code starts looking like Python. And Python, while I like it and have been using for 20 years, I find it much less readable than C++ or Fortran, precisely for the lack of visible types. But Python is the best for quickly prototyping an application. Much better than C++.\nMore generally, I think auto makes it easier to quickly prototype. For example it would be ideal for LFortran in the Jupyter notebook setting. In production code, on the other hand, I think it makes things harder to read and maintain.

Having the type written explicitly is then just redundant information\nMost of the C++ code is nowadays written with powerful IDEs, where you can just hover over a variable to see the type. So if you are not able to deduce the type from the name, there is a fast way to look it up (other than going to some functions definition)\n\nHowever, there are no powerful native Fortran IDEs out there.

One can see evidence of this with parameterized derived type (PDT) facility starting Fortran 2003 that introduced assumed length parameter option with derived types but no assumed kind; and with assumed type ( TYPE(*) ) and assumed rank ( DIMENSION(..) ) options starting Fortran 2018.  It's unclear whether such a position against assumed kind can change in the future.\nNote the original post here is but one use case for proper GENERICS in Fortran.  Toward generics, it appears the committee is open to the notion of certain UTILITIES e.g., TYPEOF/CLASSOF intrinsic inquiry functions that can employed in dummy argument declarations.  In the same vein, I wonder if might be feasible to consider another utility, say ALL_OF, that can be allowed in constant expressions.\nConsidering the standard states in the context of standard intrinsic modules, \"The processor shall provide the named constants, derived types, and procedures described in 16.10.2\" and among the constants listed include the KINDs of intrinsinc types such as REAL_KINDS, INTEGER_KINDS, CHARACTER_KINDS, etc., a utility such as ALL_OF can make feasible the following which might make it easier for processors to do the needful, meaning put together all the necessary wiring toward the generic interface needed by a coder, as illustrated in the original post.\nfunction log10(x) result(r)\n   use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : REAL_KINDS\n   real(kind=ALL_OF(REAL_KINDS)), intent(in) :: x \n   integer, parameter :: wp = kind(x) ! no longer a forward reference to x\n   real(kind=wp) :: r\n   r = log(x) / log(10._wp)\nend"

It would be nice to see the language address this in the future.\" and who provides other use cases later in the thread involving designing of libraries using Fortran.\nI'll check but my recollection is a similar need has been expressed on other forums (comp-fortran-90 mailing list or even J3 itself) re: derived type (or \"classes\") and type-bound procedures vis-a-vis the current accessibility statements with PUBLIC/PRIVATE that work at the MODULE level in Fortran.\nSo my thought was to consider the concept of EXTENSIBLE MODULEs as I had mentioned in the Intel forum link above which, if combined suitably with the concept of PACKAGEs and/or NAMESPACEs, can prove quite handy, I believe.\n\nextend (!) the EXTENDS facility in the language to MODULEs as well and to introduce OVERRIDABLE keyword and see if this can address the \"capability gap\" mentioned by IanH above.  For example, say the language allowed the following:\n\nmodule, overridable :: b_m\n   ! NOTICE the keyword above implying this module is EXTENSIBLE\n   ! By default, modules are to be NON_OVERRIDABLE\n\n   implicit none\n\n   private\n\n   type, abstract, public :: b_t\n   contains\n      private\n      procedure(Ip), pass(this), deferred :: p\n   end type b_t\n\n   abstract interface\n      subroutine Ip( this)\n         import :: b_t\n         class(b_t), intent(inout) :: this\n      end subroutine Ip\n   end interface\n\nend module b_m\nmodule, extends(b_m) e_m\n   ! NOTICE extends keyword above\n\n   implicit none\n\n   private\n\n   type, extends(b_t), public :: e_t\n   contains\n      procedure, pass(this) :: p => e_p\n   end type e_t\n\ncontains\n\n   subroutine e_p( this)\n      class(e_t), intent(inout) :: this\n   end subroutine e_p\n\nend module e_m\n\nThen can one effectively view a new module (e_m) as belonging to the same scope as base module (b_m) and thereby what's private to b_m can become accessible to the extended module.  Developers of base module can mark it as either OVERRIDABLE (or a keyword of another name , say EXTENSIBLE) or NON_OVERRIDABLE (a keyword which already exists in the context of TBPs or a new one, say NON_EXTENSIBLE).  The default will be such as to be consistent with existing code.  I wonder if this can give flexibility to coders when it comes to extending derived types.  My thought is to introduce functionality somewhat similar to \"internal\" (or protected or even friend) inheritance in other OO languages where \"children\" can access certain information from \"parents\" that others consumers cannot."

                    "text": "Let's discuss the various approaches on a simple example from #46. The syntax is just preliminary (I don't even like it myself, but that's not the point here):\n    <T> function f(x)\n    <T>, intent(in) :: x\n    f = x + 1\n    end function\nThis is just the old fashioned C++ style templates. What we discussed at the J3 meeting is that this causes slow compile times and very long unreadable error messages. The solution to both is to provide some kind of an interface (I just wrote this up, there might be some slight mistakes):\n  type, requirements :: T\n  contains\n    generic :: operator(+) => plus\n  end type\n\n  abstract interface\n    function plus(lhs,rhs)\n      type(T), intent(in) :: lhs, rhs\n      type(T) :: plus\n    end function\n  end interface\n\n    type(T) function f(x)\n    type(T), intent(in) :: x\n    f = x + 1\n    end function\nThen when you use this, you can just call it with any type that satisfies the type, requirements :: T above, and you do not subclass it. As an example both of these should just work:\ninteger :: a, b\nb = 1\na = f(b) # a will be equal to 2\nand\nreal :: a, b\nb = 1\na = f(b) # a will be equal to 2\nas well as any user defined type that defines operator(+) with the above signature:\ntype(user_type) :: a, b\nb = ...\na = f(b) # \"a\" will be equal to \"b\" + 1\nThe way this would work is that the compiler would check that user_type or integer or real (from the above three examples) satisfies the type, requirements :: T \"interface\". If it does, then it compiles and works. If it does not, then it emits a nice error message why the user type does not satisfy the interface. Finally, while compiling the generic function \"f(x)\" above (typically in some library), the compiler will check that the body of the function only uses operations are declared in the \"interface requirements\" T. If the function \"f\" uses an operation that was not defined, the compiler will emit an error right away (as opposed to at instantiation time, as in current C++). The compile times will be shorter also, because the compiler only needs to compile \"f\" once (and check that it conforms to the type \"T\"). After that, at instantiation time, the compiler only has to check the user type against the interface \"T\", it does not have to go through the whole subroutine ensuring that everything is used correctly for the given case. This roughly corresponds to \"strong concepts\" from C++ (proposed for C++11, but did not get in).\nThe current C++ has so called \"weak concepts\", where the compiler checks user code at instantiation time against the interface. But it does not check the code of \"f\" against T. So there can still be long error messages.\nSo this is roughly what we discussed at the last J3 meeting. See here for more info: #4 (comment)."

I initially thought they are the same, but after seeing more examples and carefully reading what you wrote, it seems maybe they are not the same. If you could help clarify that, I would really appreciate it.\nRegarding your last comment about runtime instantiation: I think that is no different to using templates in C++ with virtual functions ---- they will resolve to the base class function, known at compile time, not the overloaded function known at runtime. So the above example in C++ would return 1.\nIf you want it to resolve to the \"overloaded\" function (and return 2), you have to use the CRTP pattern where you explicitly type the base class to a subclass at compile time, and then the template resolves to the overloaded function, at compile time.\nI would think the above design (everything at compile time) would make the most sense, as there will be no runtime overhead."

I would propose some be added to the Fortran standard as well. That way intrinsic types could be used for at least some traits. It would also beneficial if there was some way to add traits, or even type bound procedures, to intrinsic types. I don't know if that's too much to ask, but Rust has it. Or perhaps your idea of not specifying which traits a type implements would be sufficient.\nI was unclear on that behavior of C++. What does Fortran currently do in this situation? I haven't tested it. I like the idea of no runtime overhead, but sometimes you can't get away from it. In my example, of f calling g, would the whole call chain have to be instantiated at call f(x)?

One should leave a potential use of some similar feature for compile-time polymorphism (i.e. generics) to some later revision, that will deal with such complications separately.\nA 'trait' as it was called above is, in Fortran speak, nothing but an abstract type, with the important restriction that it is prohibited to contain any fields (i.e. variables) or non-deferred methods, i.e. any implementation code. Like an abstract type it may contain deferred procedures, and like an abstract type it cannot be instantiated.\nI prefer the name 'interface type' instead of 'trait' because the syntax for the aforementioned semantics most compatible with present-day Fortran is something like the following\ntype, abstract, interface :: InterfaceType1\ncontains\n  procedure(proc), deferred :: method1\nend type InterfaceType1\n\nabstract interface\n  subroutine proc()\n  end subroutine proc\nend interface\n\n(notice the nice double occurrence of \"abstract\" and \"interface\" for consistency). So the only new thing required above is the new type-qualifier \"interface\" in the type declaration. Thus the compiler will know that the insertion of anything above the contains statement is forbidden, and that any procedure declared below the contains statement must be deferred.\nTo use the feature one will simply code the following\ntype, implements(InterfaceType1) :: ConcreteType\ncontains\n  procedure :: method1\nend type ConcreteType\n\n\nand provide an implementation of method1. Notice that it is this mechanism (i.e. \"implements\" inheritance) which will allow polymorphism, e.g. if InterfaceType1 is used in another type, like so\ntype :: SomeOtherType\n  class(InterfaceType1), allocatable :: obj\nend type SomeOtherType\n\n\nI think that no completely new syntax should be necessary here. We should still be able to use the \"class\" statement, since InterfaceType1 is nothing but a (special) form of an abstract type, and \"implements\" inheritance is a (special) form of inheritance. But I'd like to hear other views on this.\nIf we need to conform to two InterfaceTypes we would have, e.g., something like the following:\ntype, implements(InterfaceType1,InterfaceType2) :: ConcreteType\ncontains\n  procedure :: method1\n  procedure :: method2\nend type ConcreteType\n\n\nThis could then be combined also with implementation inheritance to, e.g., inherit variables and concrete versions of method1/method2 from some ConcreteBaseType\ntype, extends(ConcreteBaseType), implements(InterfaceType1,InterfaceType2) :: ConcreteType\ncontains\n  procedure :: method1\n  procedure :: method2\nend type ConcreteType\n\n\nSo, one would obtain a two-tiered inheritance capability, one to enable polymorphism, and one to inherit implementations (if one so desires), the same way it works in Java. It is the lack of such a feature which is responsible for most of the \"select type\" downcasting non-sense that we currently have to contend with."

I would like to restrict access to XX and YY so they can only be used by descendants of KK. At present the only way to do this is to move the code defining that data from XX and YY so it appears in module KK. This works.\nSuppose now that I would like to restrict access to this data within the submodules. Suppose I want AA and BB to have access to the data originally in XX, but disallow CC from such access. This can be achieved, but it requires an additional submodule to be created: let's call it sXX. sXX must be a direct descendant of KK; and AA and BB must be made descendants of sXX. The data that was in XX must appear in sXX. Again, this works.\nSuppose now that I realize that AA should NOT have access to the data originally in module YY, but it must remain available to BB and CC. ...AFAICS, there is no way to arrange the tree of the submodules to achieve this. I can, of course, go back to the original setup, where XX and YY are vanilla modules, but this means they would be \"public\", available to all other code in the program.\nWhat I propose, therefore, is to allow a submodule like sXX to be named on a USE statement in another submodule, providing they both have the same ancestor. AFAIK one cannot specify a submodule name on a USE statement, so relaxing this rule within a submodule set seems appropriate to me. This would allow data to be shared in a flexable way, while keeping it private inside the submodule set.\nI guess there would need to be some rule requiring sXX to contain only data... or maybe not? Would it be useful to restrict access to procedures as well? Not sure of this...",

Leaving that issue aside for the moment, we could do the following:\nmodule example2\ntype :: indexed\ncontains\n    procedure :: index_proc\n    generic :: operator(()) => index_proc\nend type indexed\n\ncontains\n\nreal function index_proc(self, arg1, arg2, arg3)\n    class(indexed), intent(in) :: self\n    integer, intent(in) :: arg1, arg2, arg3\n    called_proc = arg3 ** (arg1 + arg2)\nend function index_proc\n\nend module example2\nThe functionn called for indexing would need to accept scalar integer arguments of intent(in) and return a scalar result. The compiler could then handle \"array-slicing\" as though the function were elemental (perhaps require it to be declared as such?) and were passed an array of integers corresponding to the slices.\nThe issue becomes how to distinguish between these two distinct use cases. Some different approaches:\n\nelide this and specify that the compiler will only allow slices as arguments when the bound-procedure meets the requirements set out in the previous paragraph\nintroduce attributes callable and indexable for derived types, indicating how operator(()) should be interpreted\nspecify these attributes at the generic declaration within the derived type\nintroduce some sort of different operator type for each of these cases\n\nPersonally, I think the first of these makes the most sense."

I also do a similar thing when a type component depends dynamically on other data and so varies \"in time\". Otherwise, I think we may need to keep track of the update status of such components, e.g. by some flags (in my case, I use both approaches). We can also make a local variable by calling computed properties first (e.g., before entering a heavy loop) and use the local variable in a heavy loop (to avoid the efficiency issue). On-the-fly computation is also sometimes useful (IMO) to make the \"responsibility\" of underlying data clear (so that only one basic component is responsible for other dependent properties).\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties\nhttps://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Properties.html"

(I remember there were several related discussions on comp.lang.fortran, but cannot find the threads right now...) For example, something like\nmy_data(idat) % its_sub_obj(iobj) % another_sub_obj(isubobj) = my_data(idat) % its_sub_obj(iobj) % another_sub_obj(isubobj) + 1\n\n(In the above, I have used \"idat\" etc to distinguish indices for different data types.)  I experience this situation rather often when I use OO-style coding. Because it is too tedious to write, I use a preprocessor to convert a nonstandard short-hand notation (in my Fortran-like sources) into the original form above. If the standard provides \"+=\" and \"*=\", I would of course use it (rather than relying on a local converter/preprocessor approach).\nIn addition to writing a code, it is also painful (to me) to need to read such a code written by others, because I must read long entity names twice until I notice that it is simply an increment of it. When indices are rather complicated or multi-dimensional, repeating multiple indices on both sides can also be more error-prone than using +=.\nAlso, I feel \"-=\" and \"/=\" are not particularly necessary, because they can be expressed by \"+=\" and \"*=\". In my codes, the former appear much less frequently (maybe close to none?) than the latter.\n(By the way, on comp.lang.fortran, there was a discussion that ASSOCIATE could be used to avoid typing a long entity name twice, e.g.,\nassociate( x => my_data(idat) % its_sub_obj(iobj) % another_sub_obj(isubobj) ) \nx = x + 1\nend associate\n\nbut I feel it is not very readable than the usual approach in other languages\nmy_data(idat) % its_sub_obj(iobj) % another_sub_obj(isubobj) += 1\n\n(I used the word \"usual\" because \"+=\" etc have been introduced even in a basic tool like bash and I often use them.)"

            "text": "Problem\nCurrently the standard defines the event_type to have an internal event count that is an integer with atomic_int_kind. When you make event post(), the event count is incremented by 1. If you do event wait() on the event, the count is decremented by 1, or until_count if provided. However event wait() is a blocking statement. To do non-blocking polling of events, Fortran 2018 provides the intrinsic subroutine event_query().\nAs far as I can tell, the standard doesn't dictate the size of atomic_int_kind. On my platform (gcc-9.2.0, OpenCoarrays-2.8.0), atomic_int_kind is the same as int32, which has the maximum value of 2147483647. You can see where this is going: If you post events from one or more images, and poll them using event_query(), the event count may go out of range in long-running programs.\nWhat happens if the event count range is exceeded? I don't think the standard specifies.\nExample\nCompile, then run this program on two or more images:\nprogram event_count_limit\n\n  use iso_fortran_env, only: event_type, int64\n  implicit none\n  type(event_type) :: event[*]\n  integer(int64) :: n = 0\n\n  if (this_image() == 1) then\n    do\n      call event_query(event, n)\n      print *, n, '/', huge(n)\n      call execute_command_line('sleep 1')\n    end do\n  else\n    do\n      event post(event[1])\n    end do\n  end if\n\nend program event_count_limit\n(I use int64 for n intentionally to demonstrate that the limit is in the internal count representation)\nYou should get the output like this:\n                   13 /  9223372036854775807\n              5878597 /  9223372036854775807\n             11904877 /  9223372036854775807\n...\n           2120568619 /  9223372036854775807\n           2126577421 /  9223372036854775807\n           2132538217 /  9223372036854775807\n           2138522898 /  9223372036854775807\n           2144551285 /  9223372036854775807\n          -2144391377 /  9223372036854775807\n          -2138394635 /  9223372036854775807\n          -2132374894 /  9223372036854775807\n...\n\nIf I post continuously from 5 images, my event count overflows in ~10 minutes. If the event count were a higher integer kind, e.g. int64, it would overflow in > ~70000 years.\nSolution\nIntroduce higher atomic kinds to iso_fortran_env, e.g. atomic_int64_kind, and:\n\nuse the highest available in event_type; OR\nallow user to set the kind when invoking the event_type constructor, for example:\n\nuse iso_fortran_env, only: atomic_int64_kind, event_type\ntype(event_type) :: notification[*]\nnotification = event_type(count_kind=atomic_int64_kind)\nNote\nThis issue was raised by my technical editor while reviewing my chapter draft on teams, events, and collectives, paraphrasing: \"What happens if the maximum event count is exceeded in long-running programs?\". I didn't think of this until he asked.",

It might be that compilers will support it for a long time for practical reasons, but the standard should simply say that fixed-form is deprecated and provide a canonical conversion tool that works with any code. That way the community will simply move code over (automatically).\nHowever I would not use Python 2 to 3 as an example, as that script didn't actually work properly, due to the dynamic nature of Python and caused projects to invest insane amount of efforts to do the port. See my blog post with details: https://ondrejcertik.blogspot.com/2013/08/how-to-support-both-python-2-and-3.html. On the other hand, for the fixed-form, I think there might be a way to do this fully automatically and robustly --- but we need to do try this and ensure it works with any code out there, before deprecating fixed-form."

There is a section in the standard for deleted, but there is no deprecated.  Don't know if any ISO or INCITS considerations come into play here when it comes to these kinds of classification.\nThere appears an extremely strong resistance to mark features as deleted.\nBut the advantages of deletions are obvious: once something is deleted, the standard text (e.g., section 6 in current standard) no longer needs to cover that feature plus a compiler implementation, especially a new one, can decide not to support those deleted features.  This might free up development resources to focus on new features while attracting certain customers (I know of some) who want nothing whatsoever to do with legacy aspects and want their code as well as compiler tool chains to focus exclusively on modern coding practices."

I wrote my own code (in Fortran) to do that 20 years ago. Most current Fortran books suggest a strategy for continuations of placing an ampersand in column 73 on the continued line and ampersands in column 6 for the continuation. Detecting continuations is also trivial (just look for characters in column 6). The hard part of conversion though is dealing with what I call Stupid Programmer Tricks (ala Lettermans Stupid Human Tricks) where folks insisted on inserting white spaces between characters in reserved words etc. My \"favorite\" one was in a very large DoE program where one of the programmers (I think a grad student or a post-doc who didn't know better) thought it was jolly fun to  put spaces between the letters of subroutine and the subroutine name ie\nS U B R O U T I N E   M A T M O D. The real complexity comes when you want to shift things over to column one and then refactor the code to some indentation pattern that suits your programming style. Also if you want to lower case on all or some of the text to get away from the ALL UPPER CASE shouting, you have to deal with detecting and handleing character strings where you might not want the case to change.  Still all of this can be handled by a competent Python/C++/Java (and even Fortran) programmer or any one (on Linux) with sed/awk and bash scripting skills. Going up to the next level and generating a tool to do a complete \"makeover\" that will convert DO loops to block constructs, change GOTOs to If/Then/Else is a much harder task and probably requires using the current compiler front ends and the ASTs etc generated as the first pass. Maybe some tools to do this can be written for LFortran and flang/f18 using LLVM but I know very little about LLVM so I'll let the experts comment on that."

I don't see fixed-form as an embarrassment and most people learning Fortran start using free-form directly (or at least I hope so!).\nI can perhaps see a technical argument, that currently compilers assume .f files are in fixed-form, leading to the problem that @sblionel blogged about: https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/01/11/doctor-fortran-in-source-form-just-wants-to-be-free. Maybe this discussion should be about standardizing the file extension instead, like @jacobwilliams has written about previously (see here http://degenerateconic.com/fortran-file-extensions/ ).\nIf fixed-form was removed/deprecated then we, modern free-form Fortran people, could again use the .f file ending, instead of defaulting to .f90 (which we use just out of convenience since it directly works on both the Intel and gfortran compiler, without the need for extra compiler flags)."

Sure, for some people it's great that they can still compile their 50 year old code without modifications, but I think in the long run, it's very bad for the future of the language.\nPeople are not choosing Fortran anymore. Young people are not learning it. Most people still equate Fortran with FORTRAN 77. One of the reasons for this is the vast amount of FORTRAN 77 code out there in the wild. Look at all the old FORTRAN 77 code that has been wrapped via SciPy. People see this stuff and think that's what Fortran is (and they know that they want nothing to do with it). It would be better if this old stuff just wasn't compilable anymore. Then people would either just abandon it (which is going to happen anyway at some point), or modernize it.\nBackwards compatibility is great, but at some point it's time to move on. The time has long passed. People complain about the Python 2-3 transition, but in the end everyone is going to just deal with it. Python 3 probably has more users than all of Fortran, and conversion from fixed to free form is not nearly as difficult as converting from Python 2 to 3 (not even close). That's why an official conversion routine would be vital.\nI know the committee doesn't agree, but getting new people onboard should be more important than backward compatibility. I see fixed-form source (along with implicit typing and other atavistic nonsense) as a gangrenous limb that needs to be removed before it kills the patient. :)"

Fixed-form source affects only the part of the parsing code that preprocesses and normalizes the source in memory (stripping comments, joining continued lines, &c.) prior to running the recursive descent backtracking parser proper.\nI searched through this code to count the lines that I could delete if fixed form source did not exist, and came up with a total of 250 lines, many of which were comments or just }.  In the parser proper, fixed form affects two lines of source (they suppress a warning about missing white space where free form requires it).  And there's roughly 20 lines of code elsewhere that manages the setting and clearing of the flags that indicate fixed-form source.\nSo that adds up to about 1.3% of the parser, which itself constitutes about 1/3rd of the f18 front-end."

The issue I notice across many threads here and it's one of non-technical counter-arguments to original posts.  A basic fact with Fortran, nearly 3 decades after Fortran 90 revision, is that when it comes to certain legacy aspects such as implicit typing, fixed-form source, etc., the requests and suggestions to move forward as in the original post here and which allow the language to progress more freely are overarching considerations and can scarcely be put forth using any technical points given how the support toward the legacy aspects permeates across the standard, its development, and implementations in many subtle, hidden, and now 41 years after ANSI document on FORTRAN 77 in overwhelmingly harmful ways.\nUnder the circumstances, it's those making counterarguments who should have to strive to be technical, particularly from any of the points listed toward \"creating a positive environment\" under https://github.com/j3-fortran/fortran_proposals/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

Indeed,  I am skeptical that the (hypothetical) deletion of fixed form will actually contribute to giving any fresh impression to new users or encouraging new projects in Fortran. This is because many users already know free form and have been using it (unless fixed form is enforced by existing projects). Nevertheless, there is a continuing decline in the number of new projects  (according to #106 and also from my experience...), suggesting that key problems are not fixed vs free form.\nOn technical sides, I also think it is rather easy to make new syntaxes to fit with fixed form (e.g., #102). For enumerators (#11), simply switching the keywords ENUMERATOR and ENUM makes it less verbose, even if we cannot omit ENUM inside the construct (and there also seem more concise syntaxes possible...).\n\nI do not agree that fixed-form source is why (allegedly) young programmers are not learning Fortran.\n\nWhile I agree with the above sentence,\n\nI also disagree with that basic premise. While Fortran is not often taught in the US, in favor of sparkly languages not common in production environments, it is widely taught in Europe and Asia. This isn't the standard's fault.\n\nmy experience is very different from Steve's assumption above. For example, in our (combined) group, the ratio of students who use Fortran has significantly dropped in the last 10 years because new staffs are using C++ (and so their students as well). Another factor that accelerates this trend is the retirement of old professors who \"enforced\" students to use Fortran (apart from whether it is good or not).\nI am also not sure about the popularity of Fortran in Asia now; for example, there seems to be a growing community of Julia in China (with a dedicated Discourse site in Chinese https://discourse.juliacn.com/). In Japan, there are few books of Fortran sold in book stores (which can be noticed very easily). As for UK, I remember having seen a web page showing that the fraction of Fortran programs used in ARCHER (a UK supercomputer) is now about 50 % or so (? I will search for the original page if necessary), while Fortran dominated such supercomputers in ~2000 (IIRC). Even that 50% is very likely dominated by well-established program suites (e.g., VASP for materials science), and the ratio of new programs is unknown (at least I did not find any new program names in the application list shown in the web page). So, my experience is \"not at all optimistic\". I also think such a situation of course relates to the current standard, at least partly (again IMHO)."

But the further development of the standard is freed up from the confines of fixed-form.\nAs indicated in #108 (comment) with the committee approach of which I've been acutely aware, my worry all along has been even the features toward Fortran 202Y - say GENERICS and perhaps exception handling or one or two others if they get considered - would all need to be compatible in their design with fixed-form source.  My experience remains the need to remain compatible with fixed-form has adversely impacts VERBOSITY in Fortran.\nUnless the compromise indicated by @certik can be pursued with some urgency, there remains the risk of suboptimal designs of new features in Fortran due to support for fixed-form source and that is not at all a healthy and encouraging prospect for developers like @jacobwilliams who are among the few persevering with Fortran."

But that ship has sailed; adding a redundant ATTRIBUTES(...) syntax would not enable any new capability.\n\nCHARACTER*NAMEDCONSTANT does not conform to the standard but CHARACTER(NAMEDCONSTANT) does.\nAnd a function declaration such as CHARACTER(NAMEDCONSTANT)IMPUREELEMENTALFUNCTIONFOO() is standard-conforming in fixed-form source (assuming other requirements are satisfied) but obviously not in free-form source.  Regardless I find it irrelevant to the discussion in #92 on FUNCTION or SUBROUTINE declarations.\nPer section B.3.7 in 18-007r1 document toward Fortran 2018, fixed-form is obsolescent.\nBringing up a fixed-form code snippet to influence direction in any manner in a discussion to a new proposal (whatever \"tier\" it may be in, a convenience to a few mere mortal but persevering Fortranners or otherwise) which then also presents a risk to \"derail the discussion\" is exactly what I was trying to warn in my above #108 (comment).

If you're going to allocate a class, and then immediately do something with it, the amount of code here seems excessive.\nI'm not sure what the syntax would look like.\n\n@jacobwilliams , you may note inquiries such as yours have appeared on many a forum and the 'canonical' feedback to all those hapless Fortranners, often newbies dabbling with OO in Fortran, is their choices per the language standard are mostly verbose, particularly when it comes to employing polymorphism in their actual code.  That to eschew polymorphism via better OO design and analysis (OOA and OOD) of one's code is what they should pursue if they seek reduced verbosity.  Such feedback has always bothered me quite a bit even though I have on occasions suggested that to forum readers for lack of anything else.\nI personally think coder productivity is of paramount importance and convenient syntax (which many dismiss as 'syntactic sugar' to my great dismay) is a critical part of this.  I'm inclined to place high priority on enhancements involving better syntax that can improve Fortran on the verbosity ranking.  Where I work in industry there just ain't no way a team of 2 or more developers can be tasked to work using Fortran on a new project which will inevitably involve extensive utilization of object-oriented paradigm given the kind of verbose syntax on offer, especially with the managers having to keep in mind all the other limitations in Fortran when it comes to data processing.\nSo, with that preamble, a thought which I have always had (and toward which I was working to propose a paper for Fortran 202X until I got totally deflated after learning this past June the work-list for 202X was pretty much frozen with items that were decided several meetings earlier in Feb 2018) was to consider using angle brackets <..> (or another convenient notation) to signal 'dynamic' downcasting.  Say if you could do something along the following lines:\n   ...\n   class(abs_class), allocatable :: my_class\n   ...\n   allocate ( specific :: my_class )\n   ...\n   ! now access specific my_class members via dynamic cast.\n   call <specific>my_class%foo( .. )\n   <specific>my_class%bar = ..\n   ...\nThe basic idea of the above construct is to simply introduce a short-hand notation (and thus achieve your stated objective which is reduced verbosity) for each instance toward downcasting which a coder might do using the current standard with basic error handling such as with\n   ...\n   class(abs_class), allocatable :: my_class\n   ...\n   allocate( specific :: my_class )\n   ...\n   select type ( my_class )\n      type is ( specific ) ! or 'class is ( specific )\n          ! access specific member 'foo'\n          call my_class%foo( .. )\n      class default\n           error stop 'No match in type-guard statement'\n   end select\n   select type ( my_class )\n      type is ( specific ) ! or 'class is ( specific )\n          ! access specific member 'bar'\n          my_class%bar = ..\n      class default\n           error stop 'No match in type-guard statement'\n   end select\n   ...\nThe coder with <specific> downcasting option shown above achieves compactness in their code while also being forced to enter into an exception handing scenario - something  per the current standard, they then tend to overlook with missing or empty class default statements anyway and not realize no block is executed and thus experience what can be considered 'silent errors' in their code.\nMy hope was the work toward exception handling will go on in parallel as part of Fortran 202X  and a use case to handle type-guard mismatch during dynamic downcasting can get added to that work.  Alas!\nA forward-looking processor such as LFortran might even be able to try out the above with just their parser and provide feedback on the pros and cons?"

The second one, is the safety of the select type construct as brought up by @FortranFan, and that I find much more sever. Forgetting to specify a class default block can make up for hard to spot bugs.\nBut probably, this could be solved by a simple intrinsic subroutine as well, instead of a new syntax. This subroutine would associate a specific pointer with an abstract base class if possible, and either return an error code (as an optional argument) or stop the execution if the association was not possible.\nclass(abs_class), allocatable, target :: myclass\nclass(specific), pointer :: specificptr\ninteger :: error\n\nallocate(specific :: myclass)\n!

But who should WG5 represent other than the \"many users\" who \"have asked for a way to\" need this?  And since many other features of interest to said users have been deferred or rejected by WG5 for Fortran 202X anyway, why not carve out an avenue to add many other smallish features to Fortran 202X which will at least add some heft to what appears otherwise a rather dull revision considering the five years devoted to its development?\nSuggestions such as these appear to me to be in the Just do it! category and the standards revision process must have a pathway to introduce any number of them into the language as soon as the work is completed like in an online development platform.",

If the distribution of papers among subgroups is uneven (often), more people will be switched to the one with more papers.\nEach day, after the initial plenary meeting, the subgroups separate to work on papers. Features generally need specifications and syntax, and subgroup members work on those. They will also discuss proposals and decide whether or not the subgroup recommends the proposal or not.  Often new papers will be written as results of considering earlier papers, or issues that have arisen.\nEach afternoon, the subgroup head reads off a list of papers that all are to read for the next day. Some are for vote, some have \"straw votes\" used to establish a direction, some are informational and some are flagged as \"no action\". At the next morning's plenary session each paper is discussed in turn and, if needed, votes taken. Often some minor detail will arise that requires a small edit, and the paper is passed \"as amended\" where that edit is agreed upon and then a final revision is made and posted.\nWhen I built the current J3 web site, I added the ability to mark each paper with its status, and you can sort on status, making it easy to see if anything was missed. It used to be that Dan kept a spreadsheet that he updated twice daily, but this was a manual process.\nMany members read papers as they are posted to the J3 site between meetings and may engage in discussion with the author.\nIt's very unusual for any proposal to come to J3 fully-baked, no matter how qualified the author. Most smaller items can get done in one or two meetings, but larger ones take more time. A major source of issues is often how the proposal works with the rest of the language, and it is here that the more experienced members have valuable insight.\nFor 202Y, I'd love to see us begin the process with developed proposals and not just one-liners. This github could be a way to do that."

My comments and questions in the original post are not meant as any personal criticism.\nRather my assessments are based solely on \"the writing on the wall\" appearing in clearer, bolder, and darker letters every day the Fortran standard is on the verge of becoming totally irrelevant (or it always was) in so many domains.  So many code-bases get refactored away from Fortran altogether and a few that remain are left untouched in legacy FORTRAN which, in every instance I have reviewed, employs so many non-standard extensions.\nSo another question to ask after \"For whom Fortran?\" is \"Of what use is the standard?\"  Especially if the supposed INCITS standards process - as understood by the current members - comes in the way of the Fortran language?  And when so many of the widely used computing languages and paradigms - Python, Java, C#, R, MATLAB, Swift, and even C++ in its real usage  - in the scientific and technical domains are unencumbered by INCITS in any way.\nThe situation is dire.\nI find no manager financing a large, new project will now even consider 'modern' Fortran given its interminable feature-deficiencies.  Imagine letting loose a team to work on a specific engineering or technology task using Fortran with a challenging but firm deadline where the coder backgrounds right from their high school days overwhelmingly given the education system (how many engineering schools or high schools teach Fortran?) tend to be in coding in non-standard C++, Python, MATLAB, C#, Java, Swift, R, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), etc.  (and especially when they are engineers and scientists who have to apply and advance their domain-specific knowledge the foremost during the execution of the task) and where they can't locate ready and easy ways to work with the diagonal of a matrix or split a 'string' into words or apply a type-safe and secure way to handle a myriad of computation specifications, the very basic aspects which have been resolved in other languages for decades.\nPrecisely when there is a particular urgency for Fortran to catch up, the WG5 decision with Fortran 202X is severely curtailing the much-needed growth of the language.  In fact it now threatens regression among its monolingual practitioners professionally and computationally considering the general state of computing, say with the top 10 languages surveyed by IEEE (the largest body of engineers globally) that includes, as stated above, Python, C++, Java, C#, R, Swift, etc. and whose ecosystems advance at the proverbial \"speed of light\"."

Many, many customers have told me that they are not allowed to use a new feature unless said feature is supported in at least three (usually) mainstream compilers. What happens if you start cramming features into the standard is that implementors set their own priorities on which to do first, and it delays eventual support of the entire standard. This in turn means it can be many, many years before you're allowed to use feature X, even if it has been in the standard for a while.\nI respectfully disagree with @FortranFan 's calling the situation \"dire\". Maybe this reflects his own circumstances and experiences, but it doesn't jibe with what I have seen in recent years among Fortran's wide customer base. Indeed, what I heard from customers was to keep the next revision small so that vendors had a chance to catch up, thus allowing them to make use of the new features sooner. The last thing I think any of us want to see is another Fortran 2008 situation, where even 10 years after publication there are only two full implementations (one of which is for a platform most don't have access to), and some of the most commonly used compilers don't even support all of Fortran 2003."

I'm working as a research software engineer at the UK Atomic Energy Authority and new code is all written in Python or C++ (very occasionally Julia). While I have provided resources showing best-practice for those wishing to start a new project in Fortran, I know of no one who plans to do so. Codes currently written in Fortran are tending to be converted to Python for all except the most numerically-intensive parts (which get wrapped using f2py). Frankly, I would find it difficult to recommend anyone writes new software in Fortran, given the its verbosity, the poor compiler support for recent more powerful features, and the massive amount of time required to reimplement features which are built into most other languages.\nIt must be said that not all of this is due to the standards committee; the compiler vendors must take a great deal of the blame. They have failed to keep up with what new features are introduced. Gfortran at least has the excuse that it is primarily worked on by volunteers with limited time (although frankly, industry should start donating money and/or developers to overcome that). The commercial compilers really must do better, however.\nWithout meaning any animosity towards those on the committee or those working for the vendors, I fear that the current path will lead to the demise of the language in all but legacy code. The problem, I think, is this: at present the main customers for Fortran compilers are those with large legacy code-bases. Therefore, the vendors are compelled to cater towards those needs and will prioritise that over implementing new features or pursuing new, experimental, and/or innovative developments to the language. However, in doing so they are making it less and less likely that new projects/customers will use Fortran, given that there are other more powerful or productive languages they could work in. Ultimately I think this will spell the death of the language. Unfortunately, given the economic incentives, I also don't see an easy way out.\nWhat we desperately need (as others have said) is an open source Fortran compiler which offers faster development of new features, including experimental ones. Not being dependent on legacy clients, it would be less constrained by the past and could even blaze a trail for the standards committee to some extent. It would be nice if gfortran could provide this, but given its massive and intimidating nature (not to mention that it is written in C) I think this seems unlikely enough people would have the skills to get involved. Perhaps Flang or LFortran will be able to fill this role, although we would still have the issue of resources; such a project is likely to struggle if it is done purely on a voluntary basis. However, something along these lines is surely necessary if we are to modernise the language."

Currently, gfortran and ifort provide most of the latest features I use (*). I can even live with only two compilers (i.e., ifort + gfortran), though one more compiler would be great if available, of course. I guess f18 (flang) or LFortran may fit into this position, such that there are three compilers available for latest features.\nFWIW, for most of other modern languages (including D and Julia), the number of available compiler implementations is very limited (typically only 1 or 2, at most 3). Compared to that situation, I think it is already pretty nice to have three Fortran compilers that provide a (nearly) latest set of features.\n(*) I have not included PDT, derived-type I/O, FINAL etc into my \"wish list\" of implemented features because I have never used them in my codes...

Considering that none of other PGAS languages have gained popularity yet, I feel it is not strange at all that Fortran2008 is not implemented by most compilers (due to difficulty of implementation or lack of sufficient interest). So I think the lack of \"full\" F2008  compilers (with coarrays) and many feature requests in the Github page should be considered rather separately (or in an orthogonal way).\n(*1) My meaning of \"drastic\" here is that it seems closer to the addition of CS-oriented experimental feature rather than something popularly used by many users in other languages. In this sense, the order of feature introduction seems to be somewhat skewed (i.e., popular features like generics / various containers / utilities still not introduced, while more experimental parallel features introduced first). C++ seems to be introducing features in a reverse order (i.e., utilities first, parallel next). I am wondering why this choice was made for F2008 despite that  F2003 was in a more \"common\" direction (e.g., OOP). (Is the reason possibly related to High Performance Fortran and strong preference for parallel facilities in history...?) Parallel features are of course very important for HPC, but the order of feature introduction should probably have been opposite (IMHO). I feel the feature requests in this Github page are trying to fill this gap.\n\nand some of the most commonly used compilers don't even support all of Fortran 2003.\n\nI am wondering if the above sentence refers to FINAL, for example...? (e.g., gfortran seems still not good at FINAL, as mentioned in a recent comp.lang.fortran thread). The Fortran compiler in the Oracle Studio (the latest version 12.6) still lacks even the ASSOCIATE construct (if I remember correctly...). Here, I am wondering whether the committee wants to wait for these features to be \"fully implemented\" in those compilers (by neglecting the challenge of gathering contributors or a possible decline in investment). As for NAG Fortran, even the latest version does not seem to support coarrays with multiple images (correct...?) Here again, do we users need to wait for the NAG compiler to implement it (with the implementation schedule unknown?) Since some features will never be implemented in some compilers (for different reasons), it seems to me that the above model for waiting for \"overall good implementation status\" is pretty unrealistic already..."

When I was made Convenor, I decided that we were going to do it differently this time and set a firm cutoff for features, in the hope of getting the standard out in 3-4 years instead of 8. I got the approval of pretty much everyone on WG5 for this. The previous Convenor, John Reid, admitted to me that he wished he had said \"No\" more often.\nYes, I know that this means good ideas won't \"make this train\" and will have to wait for the next one. But the alternative, in my view, is worse, as there will be a steady stream of \"just one more!\" that takes away our limited resources to define and integrate, and risks making mistakes due to rushed development of what we might think is straightforward.\nThis forum is doing what I hoped for - collecting and vetting ideas for future revisions, kickstarting that process and allowing us to do more in less time."

The first step is to write a strong proposal for #135, get an agreement here at GitHub and submit to the Committee and get an agreement at the Committee. Then the next step (I think) is to also prepare the exact edits to the standard and again get everybody to agree to them. Even for a \"simple\" proposal like #135 this is actually a lot of work, that all has to happen first. Only then, if it is truly ready, I would consider that we have a frank talk about putting this into 202X. And yes, the answer at the Committee could be that we will only be able to put this into 202Y. But I am actually quite optimistic that people at the Committee might change their mind regarding this, if the feature is truly ready, meaning it does not require any more work from any Committee member.\nUntil then it's obviously not ready and I am not suggesting we open any kind of a work list and risk delaying 202X. We all want 202X to be out as soon as possible.\nAnd we are all learning how to do this the most efficiently, we are just starting with this repository and we are just starting to build a community.

Recent examples of such proposals are: #96, #100, #101, #103.\nWhile I'm personally in support of most such proposals, I often see them as putting the cart before the horse. Why so? A common argument for such additions is that they are commonly used and often re-implemented over and over again because they're not available as intrinsics. I get this. However, if such intrinsics are really needed, I imagine there'd be an obvious choice of a 3rd party library available. Reusable and open libraries emerge when the pain is high enough in the community. That's how datetime-fortran came about. Lack of open source libraries may be a signal that there just isn't great need for such procedures.\nShould we, as the Fortran community, consider working on a non-standard library that would include such procedures that we aim to the propose to the committee for inclusion in the standard? This library, or a subset of it, could over time become a candidate for the Fortran standard library, in addition to built-in intrinsics.\nI foresee multiple benefits:\n\nNear-immediate quality of life improvement for many application developers like myself.\nIn the process we'd flesh out what's really useful and what's not so important; we could troubleshoot caveats in the implementations before they're committed in writing in the standard.\nWe'd have concrete examples to show to the committee, which would make it easier to argue for their inclusion in the language;\nA maintained general purpose library could ease and increase adoption of Fortran by newcomers to the language.\nImplementations of new procedures could be used to solicit use cases.\n\nThere are quite a few projects in this spirit, such as Arjen's flibs and Ondrej's fortran-utils. Such libraries could serve as design examples, and perhaps even contribute implementations toward a dedicated non-stdlib.",

(Sort of like Boost in C++.) I am imagining that we would carefully discuss a design of each function in there. With many eyes and experiences that we have, I think it can be really well designed.\nIndeed, currently the committee always puts the carriage in front of the horse. The fix for language features is to first implement them in a compiler. That will come in a few years, hopefully even sooner. But for library additions (this feature), the fix is to first implement them in the \"standard library\", get it used in projects, gain some experience, and then write up a proposal and get it into the standard.\nWhat should we call this library?"

I know that my own group would like more control over the behavior of many transcendental functions like exp() for the sake of bit reproducibility, for example.\nOverall, I am very supportive of something like this and would love to contribute to its development."

More important are the processes that we adopt to elect candidates for stdlib, and how to implement them. Your strong experience with SymPy will come in useful here as well.\nI think a good model in the beginning would be for stdlib candidates to evolve from certain proposals in this repo. If it's a request for adding an intrinsic procedure or module to the language, we tag is as stdlib-candidate, and issues that gather strong support by the community can \"level up\" to experimental implementation in the stdlib. The stdlib could be another repo under github.com/j3-fortran. This repo would also be a place to include unit and regression tests, benchmarks, and of course the stdlib docs.\n@marshallward Good points, and I don't see a good reason to limit this to pure Fortran implementation. For example, sorting can be done with pure Fortran, but file system procedures would need quite a bit of C. I think this is OK.\nWhether some intrinsics should be part of a 3rd party library or part of the language, we'll learn that along the way.

In this stdlib the bar to get a feature in should be much higher --- there needs to be a proposal in this repository, it needs to have support from the wider community, and then also ideally several members of the committee would \"approve\" it. And the goal of stdlib would be that if the Fortran Standard Committee decides that Fortran should have a standard library specified in the Fortran Standard itself, this stdlib will be it.

Ability to \"overload\" array subsection notation facility with Containers that standard Fortran\nprovides with its 2 built-in containers: arrays and CHARACTER intrinsic type.\nc.

If the authors of the projects are ameanable, their code could be forked into a standard repostitory that aggregates the code into one place. Then we could begin a community effort to evaluate the various ways people implemented the needed functionality we envision for a standard fortran library and write reveiws on what we liked about their approach, what we didnt' like and how appropriate the code would be as a candidate for inclusion into the standard library. I think this would also benefit the original authors because it would provide useful feedback for their individual projects. We could also encourage people to consider placing their code on the repository first prior to standing up their own github site."

The 202X work list includes some features that such a library might find useful, though that of course means one can't implement things until compilers have those features. Early implementations might get revised once the features become available.\nThe idea of a \"stdlib for Fortran\" has a lot of appeal, and what I have suggested before is that proponents put together a list of what they think such a library should contain. This might influence future standardization direction, especially if prototype implementations highlight a need for certain features.\nIt would be great if some version of this library were used in a production application, with observations of how it helped and how general its application was.  The standard has many features that were first implemented outside the standard."

A project which aims to \"port\" what SciPy is for python into Fortran. The motivation is similar to what has been discussed here, although with a more scientific/math oriented goal.\nEssentially: to provide the average fortran user a \"simple\" interface to the most common task that might be required when developing on scientific project. With \"simple\" I mean something that does not make explicit use of derived data type as much as possible so that the user keep using implicit data types and arrays.  In some cases this is unavoidable of course but in most cases it can be avoided.\nThe project is open source and heavily influenced by my research activity, by older version of SciPy and by other similar projects (for which I got \"inspired\", e.g. some LAPACK interface from Certik's project :-))\nPlease feel free to use, copy, change, update, modify and whatever other action you may have in mind Scifor for the development of standard library. Scifor compiles with Cmake and try to make use of available lapack/blas/scalapack libraries present in the system (e.g. veclib, mkl, etc.): this is very important for optimisation and it is currently done also in the installation of scipy.\n[to make concrete example scipy eigh take 0.9s to work on a 1000x1000 matrix on OSX using veclib blas. Scifor used local installation of blas/lapack and took up to 5 times more for the same task. compiling against veclib blas we reached the same or better performance as python].\nUnfortunately there is essentially no documentation. (I am lazy I know).\nScifor contains already:\n\nCommon variables and physical units, colors, fonts to modify standard output\nLinear algebra: a big part of LAPACK interface, many of the utilities used in python (diag, eye, diagonal, trace, etc...). This part should also contains BLAS interface, for now it is only limited to Xgemm (as function and as operator .x.). It also includes interface to Scalapack for few methods (eigh, matrix-matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, ...). It contains also kronecker products.\nRandom number generators,  (KISS, Mersenne-Twister, etc..)\nOptimization and Root finding (interface to MinPack plus other procedures such as broyden, fzero, and other few algorithms)\nSparse Linear algebra (very basic): simple interface to P/Arpack and some Lanczos methods\nIntegration (generic interface to QUADPACK into quad, simpson, trapezoidal rule, etc..)\nInterpolation (PPPACK, CUBSPL, plus other including Numerical Recipes) 1d and 2d, linear, cubic, polynomial\nSpecial functions\nDerivatives (evaluates derivatives using increasing order finite difference methods, jacobian ,hessian, etc.)\nFast Fourier Transforms (interface to FFTPACK)\nInput/Output tools (simple save,read procedures for arrays up to 7dimensions). This is not very general indeed at least not at the level of savetxt, loadtxt. It contains some additional procedure that come useful as str which converts any standard data type into a character(len=*) of proper length. This I use a lot and is very similar to str in python.\nInput Parser: an internal data structure which parse input variables from a file or command line. all standard data type are supported.\n\nI do have some additional comments, mostly based on my experience:\n. It is important and useful to keep a modular structure so that a single part can be loaded independently of the rest.\n. There is a non-trivial issue with the automatic inclusion of the .mod files. While in c/c++ the header can be placed in suitable path of the OS, in fortran the situation is more complicated.\nI solved this by generating in Cmake a script very similar to what is used to load Ifort/MKL. Alternatively it generates an environment module file.  I did not find any better way to have automatic use of the library.\n. I think it is important to distinguish between development of intrinsic type and methods, which can import some functional programming in fortran, from the algorithms (used in different contexts). Having all in the same place is ok but in my mind these are two different problems.\nFrom my point of view, I would inspire more to Python than C/C++ in this respect.\nI am convinced that Fortran can easily reach the simplicity of python while keeping its lower level qualities.  Perhaps I can elaborate more on this.\nSorry for the very long message.\nAgain: thanks a lot for proposing this. I really really appreciate it."

Let's keep the discussion going.\nI discovered your code and linked it at fortran-lang/stdlib#1 yesterday.\nI am I think in the same camp as you are --- for example with the modern Fortran Python like interface to Lapack implemented in fortran-utils, that you ended up using. I am glad you liked it! And I would like the whole of SciPy ported to Fortran, in a natural, non OO way. I have no doubts it would go a long way towards much wider adoption of Fortran. Furthermore, I want to ship this stdlib with LFortran, that would allow interactive usage in Jupyter, thus providing almost equivalent experience as SciPy (in fact I hope much better experience!).\nOthers like @cmacmackin like OO interfaces, and I think we can have them too, in addition to non OO interfaces.\nThe other aspect is that we pretty much know how to implement all of the above --- either we have already done that, or know how to do it quickly. The biggest contribution of stdlib is to agree on an interface that we all like and approve as a community and commit to support for the long run. For example, the linalg routines, that you also ended up using or got inspired by, I designed them with a few other Fortran users about 10 years ago; but that is different and not enough --- what we are doing now is to have a much wider discussion about the API, and I would love if you could also be part of this discussion, you can start here:\nfortran-lang/stdlib#23\nfortran-lang/stdlib#10\nthen, once we mostly agree on the API, we merge into our \"experimental\" modules in master. You can see the PR 23 above for an example. Then much later, once we gain experience with the API, we will propose to move from experimental to main. The bar for that will be much higher. We are still figuring out all this workflow. But I am positive we can figure out a high quality process that would allow us to deliver on a Fortran Standard Library that we all eventually agree upon."

Here are a few minimal requirements that we are striving for stdlib to satisfy (in the future):\n\nAll API must be agreed upon by the wide community\nMust be widely used in Fortran projects\nThe stdlib github repository itself must end up a successful open source project (lots of contributors, lots of stars at GitHub, ...)\nMost community will agree that stdlib is the de-facto standard including most J3 and WG5 committee members\n\nWe are obviously not there yet, as we have just started. These goals will take years to achieve. But if we achieve these (and probably there are more goals that we need to achieve beyond these) we might start calling stdlib the standard.\nThe example you posted with leftpad in Javascript did not satisfy any of the above goals: it was quite widely used, but it had little github stars, one (?) contributor, the community did not seem to agree this is the Javascript standard library, etc. So I want to make it clear, we are not trying to achieve what leftpad did. We have much bigger goals as outlined above. In fact I would argue leftpad is an example what happens if you do not have a standard library --- people start re-implementing such basic features themselves, in an unorganized fashion and then codes start depending on such not well supported libraries and it causes all kinds of problems at outlined in the blog post you linked. If Javascript included leftpad either directly in the language, or in the standard library, there wouldn't be such a problem.\nAssuming we do achieve the above goals in the future, then it will be a good time to see if some of the stdlib's more basic functionality (such as string manipulation) could be included in the standard itself, or if the Fortran standard could standardize the API of stdlib as the Fortran Standard Library. (In fact, we do not need to wait until stdlib becomes popular, we should push good ideas in this fortran_proposal repository in parallel with stdlib.) Also hopefully, stdlib will spur discussions about Fortran language improvements that would make some usage simpler."

I used such multi-dimensional array literals only in Julia, and in that case I used white spaces for row vectors (and \"concatenate\" them).\nhttps://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/arrays/#Concatenation-1\nIt seems that Julia distinguishes column and row vectors strictly by using commas or white spaces as delimiters, while Fortran (and Matlab also?) do not seem to distinguish them.\nAs for the nested use of [...], I am afraid that it interferes with the existing syntax because Fortran \"flattens\" all array elements into a one-dimensional sequence, for example\ninteger :: a(9)\na = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\nprint *, a\ngives 1  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, while if we declare a as a(3,3), it results in a compile-time error (like \"Incompatible ranks 2 and 1 in assignment\" for gfortran). So I guess some other delimiter (like semicolon?) might be necessary.\nAnd I agree that there is ambiguity about how the array elements on the RHS are assigned to a multi-dimensional array on the LHS. I feel \"RHS = row major\" would be more reasonable because the code looks like a matrix when we separate each row via line continuation, e.g.\n    a = [ 1, 2, 3 ; &\n          4, 5, 6 ; &\n          7, 8, 9 ; ]\n\nbut I am not sure whether some people may still feel it confusing (though hopefully not)."

See this \"http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/know-\nyour-sorting-algorithm-set-2-introsort-cs-sorting-weapon/\" for more information\n!!\n!! To begin, a quicksort with a median of three pivot is used until the size of the array is less than 16.  At this point, an insertion sort is used to reduce cache overhead and tail recursion.\n!! Unfortunately, a quicksort is not ideal for sorted/almost sorted arrays or arrays with duplicate values.  Therefore if the number of iterations exceededs a threshold, a heapsort is used instead.\n!! This provides a robust sorting algorithm that is still very fast for almost sorted arrays.\n!!\n!! In this implementation, the quicksort and heapsort are unstable sorts. A stable merge sort is therefore provided as an alternative but it has an order(N) memory overhead.\n!!\n!! Often, the numbers wish to be maintained in their given order, so with an O(N) memory overhead we can sort an integer array instead by calling argsort()\nThe stable merge sort doesn't really matter for numbers, will be important if used for arbitrary types though."

There may be other platforms that don't spring immediately to mind.\nBut the fundamental issue is that there is a strong desire to keep the standard away from specifying such low-level details as the language (and programs) have a long life and technologies change. For example, a few years ago we rejected a proposal to add a way to specify allocation from \"fast memory\", since we knew this was a short-term thing.\nMy personal opinion is that building low-level stuff into the language is a waste of effort better placed elsewhere.

I can't imagine a situation where I would want to start a process, and then just hope for the best that it finishes.\nWe can, of course, do it with interfaces to system APIs (this is what I do), but then we have to write a massive amount of code that is different for different platforms.

At this time I don't have anything to add to it, but I'd like to express a few observations and open-ended questions.\n\nAs a Fortran application developer of 13 years, I found the committee quite removed and opaque, something between a benevolent mythical creature and an urban legend. Over the past few years, I've learned a lot from you, Steve, and few other members about how it works. Only recently I discovered that anybody can join the J3 mailing list, and I did. My point being, even though the J3 mailing list was publicly open, it wasn't obvious to me. It's possible that so many other people that would otherwise want to participate or just read aren't aware of it.\nNow that I understand better how it works, it makes sense why it's opaque and why the progress is so slow:\n\nIt's quite difficult to join -- be an alternate to an existing member, or pay membership to join as self.\nIt's also difficult to remain a member -- don't miss more than one meeting in a row. For many of us with busy schedules and/or lack of budget, it just doesn't work even if the good will is there.\nDiscussions via mailing lists and voting in meetings. This worked well a few decades ago, there are much better development models nowadays. This repo is a great example of one aspect of such development.\n\n\nI understand that the ultimate bottleneck is the number of compiler developers to implement features, however if the committee worked more openly and closer to the community, the community could grow and more compiler developers could join or come about by learning how to do it.\nLike @FortranFan likes to ask \"for whom Fortran?\", I think we should also ask \"for whom the Fortran Standards Committee?\". At a time when various flavors of FORTRAN were rampant in the wild, standardization made sense. I also understand that large enterprises put a lot of trust to something with an ISO stamp on it. However, does this model best serve the community, and even large enterprises nowadays? Should we look at some examples of productive language development teams like Python, Go, or Rust? Yes, they're backed by large corporations, but so is Fortran (Intel, Cray, IBM, NVIDIA etc.).\n\nAnyhow, I ramble and don't mean to hi-jack the topic further. I didn't say anything that wasn't said before, but I think they're conversations we need to have. I'm beyond grateful for the committee's and compiler developers' hard work and the way Modern Fortran has evolved. Both my research and business are in large part thanks to it, and I'm sure I'll be a happy Fortranner for years to come. However, let's keep bringing up the conversation and reassessing the best way going forward.\nIf I'd pull out anything specific to this proposal, my recommendation for the committee would be to make it easier for people to participate, specifically:\n\nLower the requirements for becoming a member and remove the requirement for physical attendance of meetings.\nAdopt a publicly open and online venue for language development. This repo is an essential step toward such venue."

As an extreme example, C++ follows this approach also, and did not standardize the syntax for multidimensional arrays (the language itself provides enough primitives for users to implement their own) and as a result C++ has dozens and dozens of incompatible array implementations.\nFortran, unlike C++, has standardized such \"simple\" things as multidimensional arrays, special functions, and everything else that is needed in practice for numerical computing.\nIt would be nice to develop general guidelines of what features are worth standardizing and which not, so that we do not need to repeat such arguments in every issue.",

I'm not familiar with C++, but it seems like they've also gone in a similar direction.\nI could see a standard library also offloading many of these discussions out of the Fortran discussion and into, say, a group devoted to such a library.  I could also imagine a standards-defining implementation (glibfort?) alongside vendor implementations, who could focus on optimizations suited for their target platforms.\nIt could also clarify exactly what can and cannot be done with Fortran itself.  If a particular intrinsic cannot be written in Fortran, then it's likely that the language either needs an extension, or is a task that one probably ought not be doing in Fortran.\nTo address your points, a standard library would help to achieve your goals:\n\n\nThey would not appear in the standard, nor would the committee need to deliberate over them\n\n\nImplementations would vary, but interfaces would not.  And in all likelihood there would not be many more implementations than there are compilers.\n\n\nA standard library could afford to be more nimble, as one could trial new libraries alongside existing compilers.  As it is, there's a big learning curve to add anything to any Fortran compiler.\n\n\nIt would help to delineate the guidelines that we seek on what ought to be a language feature, an intrinsic, or what should sit in an external library.\n\n\nI could list the various things that I would like to see in such a library, but I'll hold my tongue for now \ud83d\ude1d."

If you cannot join the committee, then the best way you can help is to constructively discuss things here and help draft proposals.\n..\n\n@certik and everyone interested in advancing Fortran:\nPlease see a similar discussion thread on the unmoderated platform of comp.lang.fortran via this link  and this one.\nWith respect to the point about joining the committee, please first consider the following:\n\n\nWhat appears is a crucial difference between joining a working committee of a national body like the so-called \"J3 committee\" for US versus the international one of WG5 with respect to all the decision-making control and influence that is effectively held by WG5 with respect to the Fortran standard.\n\n\nReaders need to keep in mind the J3 committee as a US national body can have >7 billion members from all over the world, practically all of humanity, and develop fully worked out proposals for all the features that one can ever contemplate for a programming language (Namespaces; Generics; Exception Handling; Standard Containers for strings, dictionaries, trees, etc.; Object-Oriented enhancements, Type-safe enums, and on and on) .\n\n\nJ3 can then present all those proposals at a WG5 meeting which presently comprises 3 national bodies of US, UK, and Japan only.  But if the other two national bodies - usually one representative each - happen to think all these features are not of any interest to them for whatever reason (their focus on strict numerical performance only, compiler vendor reluctance, bad mood, luddite, etc.) , each and every one of those proposals can get rejected (or deferred to an unspecified future Fortran revision in year 20YZ) by a vote of 2-1.  And which can effectively mean the vote of 2 people against the rest of humanity.\n\n\nThe bulk of feature developments occurs at physical 5-day meetings held by the J3 committee typically in Las Vegas NV on working days a few times a year (usually two).  Re: this arrangement, consider the constraints expressed by @rweed in that comp.lang.fortran thread, \"having to use our own personal time/money or beg our employers to support a trip to Las Vegas or elsewhere. If I told my boss I wanted him to pay for a trip to Las Vegas to participate in a Fortran standard committee meeting he would kick me out of his office.\"\n\n\nThus when readers such as @jacobwilliams are invited to join the committee and they accept the invitation, that can be remarkably beneficial to the quality and quantity of proposals by J3 but that might come about at possibly great personal cost (time and/or finances and/or relationships given the Vegas location) to these new members.\nBut all that effort can yet FAIL ENTIRELY to bear any fruit and can potentially make NO difference to the state of the Fortran language as constrained it is by the ISO IEC standard and whose content as well as the pace of change is completely controlled by WG5, as explained in point 3 above.\nIt can literally take DECADES and DECADES for the Fortran standard to have the simplest of features such as a string utility like SPLIT or a type-safe ENUM, facilities that pop up cleanly and efficiently in other languages such as Python (look at all their enhancement proposals), C++, C#, Julia, etc. in a matter of months or a year.\nSo how much time and effort can Fortranners afford to spend on developing this language?  How long can the practitioners wait for the language to get the features they need in their coding?\nIn effect, the arrangement with Fortran and WG5 is not all that different - philosophically speaking - from trying to join UN to achieve world peace.\nConsidering all this, the statement \"How can we liberate Fortran from the Fortran committee?\" by @jacobwilliams in #96 (comment) should really resonate with every persevering practitioner of Fortran."

First is to even have a discussion (fixed by this GitHub repo). Second is to have rules and a streamlined process in the J3 committee (proposed fix in #98). Third is to have a discussion in WG5 --- I haven't been to any meeting yet, so I don't know yet what (if anything) needs to be improved there. Then the whole process must be streamlined, hopefully sped up (#36), etc. I don't have any silver bullet, I don't think there is one."

There is quite a bit of @FortranFan 's post that is incorrect.\n..\n\nI'm yet to notice in any inaccuracy in my post, and when I do, I shall be the first to admit it.\nJust as \"shall\" carries particular meaning in the Fortran standard, my post relies on the verb \"can\" which is \"used to indicate possibility\" and the possibility is something which is more than backed up by considerable evidence given how features keep getting dropped time and again from Fortran revisions, such as BITS data type from the Fortran 2008 draft and repeatedly with the topic of this thread, string utilities .\n\n..\nIt does not take \"DECADES and DECADES\" to add features, ..\n\nNo, there is considerable evidence many features do take that long, or that matters can be worse, in that the standard may never see some features e.g., an intrinsic string type.\n,\nConsider this paper by \"ISO Meeting of Fortran Experts,\" all the way back from 1982: https://wg5-fortran.org/N001-N1100/N052.txt.  Now, consider a couple of sections from this:\n8.  Bit Data Type\n    -------------\n    This is very important for certain types of application. There has\n    been inconclusive debate over whether it should be in the core\n    language.\n\nNo amount of input from the practitioners of Fortran appears to \"settle\" this debate, why is that?  Why are there continued arguments against adding a feature and why is the rationale against doing something circular or non-technical (e.g., wait for compilers to catch up) so often?  It took 10 years - a DECADE for Fortran 2018 to be published, a minor revision to boot, and there is still a call for wait for compilers to catch up with 2008.\n12. Character Data Type Extensions\n    ------------------------------\n    Academic computer scientists have poked fun at Fortran for many\n    years and it is feared that having two such closely parallel but\n    different facilities as STRING and CHARACTER will give renewed\n    cause for mirth. More importantly, it will cause confusion to\n    users of the language, and judging by Fortran 77, possibly also to\n    implementors. Since STRING is more powerful and more general it\n    alone should be in the core and CHARACTER should be relegated to\n    the compatibility module.\n\nThe above two paragraphs are proof-positive of the wait for decades by the practitioners of Fortran in spite of them having conveyed their needs and which had the recognition by the so-called \"experts\".  These couple of basic features were up for discussion at this year WG5 meeting, what a coincidence!\nAnd what happened exactly?\n\nBITS data type got deferred,\nThere is still no STRING intrinsic type,\nEven as the CHARACTER type remains an intrinsic type with limitations such as with arrays of varying lengths and Fortran continues to mocked at and remains laughable, all but one of the utilities - the topic of this thread - gets dropped from the list.\n\nSo it was back in 1982 with BITS type, it was recognized, \"This is very important for certain types of application\"  36 years later i.e., last year we had a project (where I work) that could really have used this data type in the code design.  That's well over 3 decades later and the feature is still missing.\nThe same with string utilities.\n\n.. There has been tremendous pressure on the committee to slow down adding features so that compilers can catch up.\n..\n\nBy whom, 1 or perhaps 2 national bodies?  As evidenced in https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=20648817&objAction=Open and https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=20632887&objAction=Open?  Or due to one specific compiler vendor exerting outsized influence on these national bodies?   Regardless, this goes back to my earlier comment about how proposals can peter out at the WG5 level.\nThe users of Fortran the world over with forums online, their input to WG5 survey itself are feeding back the exact opposite: see comments such as this:\n\n\n\"Is it too late now to start this project? ..The list of new features to be added in Fortran 202X has been finalized in last August at the Tokyo WG5 meeting. More specifically, exception handling has been unfortunately rejected \" https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.fortran/dFenjU25o9k/Z5MMiXyRAAAJ\n\n\n\"Personally, it's very sad that various features are postponed or even rejected for this round of revision (which may be reasonable for the committee for various reasons), and I'm (very personally) sad that a builtin \"string\" type seems not considered even as a revision candidate\" https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.fortran/dFenjU25o9k/-t-OEW2aAAAJ\n\n\n\".. in 2019, people will use C++ instead ..\" https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.fortran/dFenjU25o9k/srcYqhXYAAAJ\n\n\n\"..

I don't find it weird at all, and I'd find it weird if it were any other way.\nI also understand your and some other people's disregard for backward compatibility, but this is subjective. For instance, I'm an application developer and member of the community, and I care about backward compatibility and consider it one of Fortran's great strengths. I also think backward compatibility is a red herring being considered an obstacle to progress. It's quite possible to advance the language while preserving backward compatibility. What I see as real obstacles are the disconnect from the community and outdated, slow processes.\nI also think it's subjective to consider only free compilers to matter. For me, both free and commercial compilers are essential. The former mostly for development, the latter for production.\nSo what do we do? Can we try to work with the committee and help them make adjustments? If you care about sticking with and advancing Fortran, commercial vendors, committees and backward compatibility are part of the course. I will keep asking \"for whom the Fortran Standard Committee?\", but at some point you got to ask where do you want to go and how can you best get there."

Once you achieve that, perhaps this community can progress to a state where such an online collaboration forum can become a productive development platform also. To paraphrase from my comment in that thread  at comp.lang.fortran:\nadopt *more* of the modern options involving online collaboration toward at\nleast the aspects in language development which fall mostly in the category\nof that mentioned in \"What is New in Fortran 2018\" document at the WG5\nwebsite i.e., \"Features that address deficiencies and discrepancies\".  In my\nmind, what is suggested in the original post here with string utilities\nfalls under this bracket.\n\nA large fraction of the scope and effort toward feature enhancements such as\nthese, the \"minor\" ones per Modern Fortran Explained, is decidedly limited.\nBut such a worklist can be very tedious and quite burdensome if it is\napproached in the traditional manner of serialized processing by a small\nsubcommitee of a burgeoning number of such requests from the users.\n\nHowever, offloading a lot of such feature develoment effort, especially the\ngrunt work that is otherwise constant with each Fortran standard revision,\nto a more modern development model which also involves crowd-sourcing from keen\nFortranners globally via online collaboration platforms and which often garners\n24x7x365 engagement from the enthusiastic Fortran community, can really help\nFortran with parallelized and semi-automated advancement.\n\nWhat is mostly required is enumeration and enunciation by Fortran (sub)\ncommittees of a basic set of language semantics (rules) and (other) requirements\nand constraints which need to be kept in mind while developing features.  The\n\"crowd\" can then iron out a lot of wrinkles in its own ideas, and even reject\na bunch of them.\n\nThe standard (sub)committee(s) would then review, refine, and redirect\ndevelopment and hopefully reduce its own burden along the way.\n\nMy bottom-line message: at least with \"Features that address deficiencies and\ndiscrepancies\" in Fortran, the standard body would do well to consider alternate\noptions to develop proposals which then allow the introduction of MORE as well\nas SPEEDIER refinements in the language.  The traditional approach of having to\njoin committees and attend physical meetings is only possible for a select few.\n\nThere is a need to continuously improve the work processes for faster development."

Does the processor provide additional kinds for, e.g. Kanji?)\n\nSo as far as things that the standard could do to help with this are in two main areas in my opinion, and at least partially orthogonal from whether this should be in the standard or in a library:\n\nBetter generic handling of intrinsic types with different kind parameters. Maybe this is via templating (#125). Maybe this is via standardized pre-processors (#65). Maybe this is by intent(out) and function return variables being allowed to adopt the same kind as an intent(in) variable (#128). Maybe this is something different that I can't think of right now.\nBetter handling of character arrays. Maybe this means optional reallocation of an array of strings on assignment (yuck!

Maybe this means a new intrinsic string type or class.\n\nThere are admittedly more work arounds for variable length string arrays, but these are at times still hampered by bugs in compiler implementations of allocatable, scalar characters in UDTs.\nSPLIT() is a good case study, as it demonstrates the awkwardness of both of the issues I highlighted above."

How about\nif int(), real(), dble() take CHARACTER as well as numeric types? CHAR() does not quite extend naturally to something that goes the other way (maybe) but an additional function to convert numeric values to strings will fill out the set.  Also, allowing CLASS(*) numerics where the TYPE matches one of the currently supported values (ie. numeric types) and CHARACTER would be very useful for writing functions that take many types without a template or repeated generic implementations for various types.  So you could write something like\nelemental function something(value)\nclass(*),intent(in) :: value\nreal :: val\n    val=real(value)\n ..\n ..\nend function something\nwould allow you to write a function that promotes(demotes) any scalar intrinsic of numeric type or string to\na REAL, for example.  You could call this routine with\n   a=something('100.345e2')\n   a=something(10)\n   a=something(300.d0)'\nI think this stays within and natually extends the Fortran syntax and solves the need for a commonly needed functionality  (It's \"Fortranic\"!). A check on range (so \"something(huge(0.0d0)\" gets caught)\nwould be a nice touch.\nIn addition\n  character(len=:),allocatable :: string\n  real :: value\n   string='my answer is '//value\nshould \"just work\" as well.  Assuming the new function STR() existed that converted anything intrinsic type to a string, this would be equivalent to  \"string='my answer is'//str(value).\nI see no need for STR() to be limited to a single parameter. If it allowed for (say 9) metamorphic values something like  call proc(str(\"my message is \",.true.,\" and the value is \",100.3)...) would allow strings to be easily generated and passed as input without having to do an internal WRITE first, for example.\nAs an example, extending the DBLE(3f) intrinsic using f2008-compliant code:\n!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nmodule M_extend\n   use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : int8, int16, int32, int64\n   use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : real32, real64, real128\n   implicit none\n   private\n   public dble                      ! extend intrinsics to accept CHARACTER values and LOGICALS\n   interface dble\n      module procedure anyscalar_to_double\n   end interface\ncontains\n!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   pure elemental function anyscalar_to_double(valuein) result(d_out)\n      use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : error_unit !! ,input_unit,output_unit\n      implicit none\n\n!$@(#) M_anything::anyscalar_to_double(3f): convert integer or real parameter of any kind to doubleprecision\n\n      class(*),intent(in)       :: valuein\n      doubleprecision           :: d_out\n      doubleprecision,parameter :: big=huge(0.0d0)\n      character(len=3)          :: nanstring\n      select type(valuein)\n       type is (integer(kind=int8));   d_out=real(valuein,kind=real64)\n       type is (integer(kind=int16));  d_out=real(valuein,kind=real64)\n       type is (integer(kind=int32));  d_out=real(valuein,kind=real64)\n       type is (integer(kind=int64));  d_out=real(valuein,kind=real64)\n       type is (real(kind=real32));    d_out=real(valuein,kind=real64)\n       type is (real(kind=real64));    d_out=real(valuein,kind=real64)\n       Type is (real(kind=real128))\n         if(valuein.gt.big)then\n            !!write(error_unit,*)'*anyscalar_to_double* value too large ',valuein\n            nanstring='NaN'\n            read(nanstring,*) d_out\n         else\n            d_out=real(valuein,kind=real64)\n         endif\n       type is (logical);              d_out=merge(0.0d0,1.0d0,valuein)\n       type is (character(len=*));     read(valuein,*) d_out\n       class default\n         !!stop '*M_anything::anyscalar_to_double: unknown type'\n         nanstring='NaN'\n         read(nanstring,*) d_out\n      end select\n   end function anyscalar_to_double\n!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nend module M_extend\n!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nprogram testit\n   use M_extend\n   implicit none\n   ! make sure normal stuff still works\n   write(*,*)'##CONVENTIONAL'\n   write(*,*)'INTEGER         ', dble(10)\n   write(*,*)'INTEGER ARRAY   ', dble([10,20])\n   write(*,*)'REAL            ', dble(10.20)\n   write(*,*)'DOUBLEPRECISION ', dble(100.20d0)\n   ! extensions\n   write(*,*)'##EXTENSIONS'\n   write(*,*)'CHARACTER       ', dble('100.30')\n   write(*,*)'CHARACTER ARRAY ', dble([character(len=10) :: '100.30','400.500'])\n   ! call a function with a metamorphic argument\n   write(*,*)'METAMORPHIC     ', promote(111)\n   ! settle this once and for all\n   write(*,*)'LOGICAL TRUE    ', dble(.true.)\n   write(*,*)'LOGICAL FALSE   ', dble(.false.)\n   write(*,*)'LOGICAL ARRAY   ', dble([.false., .true., .false., .true.])\ncontains\n   function promote(value)\n      class(*),intent(in) :: value\n      doubleprecision     :: promote\n      promote=dble(value)**2\n   end function promote\nend program testit\n!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHandles CHARACTER strings easily:\n##CONVENTIONAL\nINTEGER            10.000000000000000     \nINTEGER ARRAY      10.000000000000000        20.000000000000000     \nREAL               10.199999809265137     \nDOUBLEPRECISION    100.20000000000000     \n##EXTENSIONS\nCHARACTER          100.30000000000000     \nCHARACTER ARRAY    100.30000000000000        400.50000000000000     \nMETAMORPHIC        12321.000000000000     \nLOGICAL TRUE       0.0000000000000000     \nLOGICAL FALSE      1.0000000000000000     \nLOGICAL ARRAY      1.0000000000000000        0.0000000000000000        1.0000000000000000        0.0000000000000000"

            "text": "Recently, there has been a growth of interest in automatic differentiation tools used in adjoint modelling. Some popular projects in the Python and Julia worlds are JAX and\nJuliaDiff, respectively.\nOf course, plenty of such tools exist for other languages including (older) Fortran ones such as adjac, OpenAD, Tapenade, AUTO_DERIV, and ADIFOR just to name a few. At NAG they also support some algorithmic differentiation tools in the form of overloaded C++ classes.\nThe growth of interest in algorithmic differentiation appears to be fueled by the needs of the machine learning community. The Julia language developers are trying to push it so far to even have a differentiable programming language. A recent blog post touches on this topic from the perspective of a Fortran programmer (the idea for submitting opening this issue/proposal comes from reading this blog post).\nI have no experience in this area (just plans to have a closer look in the future), but I am wondering whether some of the older tools (for example ADIFOR dates back to 1992) have achieved a level of maturity, where they might be implemented directly into the language. I am guessing the compiler developers already employ some experts in this field. It would be interesting to see whether an experimental branch of the LFortran compiler could make this idea take off. I can imagine that making these tools easy to use (while keeping the performance) would generate some new interest in Fortran and also send the message that Fortran is a living language (otherwise, we might end up in the situation where those rare Fortran programmers still left start calling ODE solvers through the Julia C API or simply abandoning ship).\nGiven that Fortran was named and developed for the purpose of \"formula translation\", one could imagine that in the current decade (or perhaps century) we also continue down this path of adding further mathematical abstractions such as differentiation. A related idea would be to introduce a new type for dual numbers, which can also be used for the purpose of automatic differentiation (see here and here).\nI look forward to reading the comments from those of you who have used/authored such automatic differentiation tools in the past.",

There are things we just cannot do right now.\nFor example: say we have a function that depends on an intrinsic real variable. This function could be using hundreds of modules, third-party codes, etc. I want to be able to call this function to get the result, but I also want to call the function and get the derivative, by replacing this real variable with some kind of autodiff class. I want both of these calls to be as efficient as they can be. Maybe this class is not even known about by some of the third-party code. I think the Julia multiple dispatch thing is the closest thing I've seen that can do something like this, but I've not actually used it before. Fortran needs that desperately. I don't want to have to clutter potentially hundreds of thousands of routines to put select type everywhere, or put all the logic in include files and duplicate all the interfaces.

However, based on further description of the need, it may be possible to workaround it by designing the 'my_class' as a parameterized derived type.\nAnyways, the need \"I want to be able to define a function that behaves like, for example, the intrinsic SIZE function\" is yet another instance where the Fortran standard makes certain allowances for intrinsic procedures (generic like ABS, FINDLOC, etc; variadic like MAX, MIN) and intrinsic types that are inextensible, single-component like C_PTR, etc. but does not extend the same courtesy for user procedures and types\nThis really comes to 'bite' because the committee refuses to include certain intrinsic 'classes' (a la what other languages now already have e.g., C++ in STL with std::string, std::vector, std::variant) that are so badly needed in the language but then there is extreme recalcitrance to offer to coders all the tools and mechanisms they need to build their own such 'classes'."

Few join with any background in Fortran, few schools teach Fortran. Then one loses them at 'hello' itself, meaning at the very beginning stage when one stresses to them the need to type 'implicit none' in every scope.\"\nAs I show with this link  and with even another ISO IEC working group (WG23) document on vulnerabilities with Fortran, countless amount of time and effort is expended to ensure \"implicit data declarations (are) banned, by inserting \"IMPLICIT NONE' in all program units\".\nThere is no reason any longer to leave such an important aspect to all the other coders and to anything else (e.g., processor options -fimplicit-none) but the goddamn standard itself.\nInterestingly, one arm of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22 in WG23 itself states the following which is unfortunately not paid heed to by the other in WG5:\n\n7 Language specific vulnerabilities for Fortran\n\n8 Implications for standardization \n  Future standardization efforts should consider:\n  \u2022 Requiring that processors have the ability to detect and report the occurrence within a\n    submitted program unit of integer overflows during program execution.\n  \u2022 Requiring that processors have the ability to detect and report the occurrence within a\n    submitted program unit of out-of-bounds subscripts and array-shape mismatches in\n    assignment statements during program execution.\n  \u2022 Requiring that processors have the ability to detect and report the occurrence within a\n    submitted program unit of invalid pointer references during program execution.\n  \u2022 Requiring that processors have the ability to detect and report the occurrence within a\n    submitted program unit of an invalid use of character constants as format specifiers.\n  \u2022 Requiring that processors have the ability to detect and report the occurrence within a\n    submitted program unit of tests for equality between two objects of type real or complex.\n  \u2022 Requiring that processors have the ability to detect and report the occurrence within a\n    submitted program unit of pointer assignment of a pointer whose lifetime is known to be\n    longer than the lifetime of the target or the target attribute of the target.\n  \u2022 Requiring that processors have the ability to detect and report the occurrence within a\n    submitted program unit of the reuse of a name within a nested scope.\n  \u2022 Providing a means to specify explicitly a limited set of entities to be accessed by host\n    association.\n  \u2022 Identifying, deprecating, and replacing features whose use is problematic where there is\n    a safer and clearer alternative in the modern revisions of the language or in current\n    practice in other languages.\n\n\n\nConsidering the last bullet, nothing stands out as much as implicit typing and implied SAVE requiring immediate deletion from the Fortran standard."

Unfortunately, this is another one of those obsolete features that somehow take precedent over more modern and more useful coding constructs because of the \"we can't break code\" mantra. Every time I see this I immediately interpret it as \"we can't break code by adding features or deleting obsolete ones that people are paying us money to help maintain\". I'm becoming more convinced that the only way to save Fortran is to first declare that what is currently called Fortran has reached its \"end of life\" and is entering maintenance mode. Then maybe some enterprising young person will \"fork\" the language and produce a compiler that ONLY supports the things in the current standard that haven't been declared obsolete and strips out all the other cruft (DEC extensions etc.) vendors insist on adding and then give it a new name and market it is as a new language. I've alway wondered what price we are paying in the way of increased compiler bugs etc. because developers have to keep dragging the weight of all the obsolete stuff around just to satisfy a few hid bound organizations that are too cheap to make the effort to update their codes. I put the following question to the F18/LLVM/Flang developers and others. How much time and code are you wasteing trying to support features that have been declared obsolete by the standard and other things like DEC extensions. I guess what I'm saying is isn't it time we had a new vision of Fortran that doesn't include or support fixed source, implicit typing, all obsolete features and existing features we can all (mostly) agree were either a mistake to add to the language or are in their current form poorly implemented. I want a new standard that officially bans them and compilers that refuse to compile if it sees any of those features. Again, the only way I see that happening is to just fork what we can all agree are the best parts of \"modern Fortran\", come to a consensus on what new features we think would add value to that core capability and if necessary\nwrite an new standard, call it a new name, and market it to the world as a new language.\nAs to @jacobwilliams proposal, I still see this as a procedural issue with the vendors more than a technical one. The path of least resistance is to make explicit typing the default and have compiler switches that people who insist on still doing implicit typing must turn on to get the old default. To me this is the logical approach since no mods would have to be made to old code and the only impact I can see is on build options\njust my 2 cents"

If we create an incompatible language, then we are starting from scratch.

That it's the latter who will have to follow the language where it freely needs to go.  One can notice that clearly with C++ and the rapid pace and expansive scope and brave conviction of each ISO revision.  Whereas many others on the IEEE Spectrum of most popular languages in the technical arena such as Python, Java, C#, R, MATLAB, Swift, Go, and even other HPC ones such as Julia, Haskell, etc. don't even bother with such standards bureaucracy but with no less success, that's for sure.\nThere is a lesson to be learned here: at some point, the 'bureaucracy' will need to adopt the US Marines ethos: lead, follow, or get out of the way.\nThe current snail's pace of incremental abominations of the likes of implicit none (type, external) is like adding insult to injury."

For example, there are various nice languages which tries to overcome the drawback of C/C++ (e.g., the D language), but AFAIK they have been still struggling for wider adoption (though, D is already 17 years old, for example). Indeed, I think the \"successful\" languages as listed in a ranking page are rather exceptional (with the reason for their success ranging very widely, like huge investment or historical reasons). Various languages for HPC have also been developed up to now, but AFAIK (again) they have been experiencing a challenge for wider adoption (e.g., as compared to C++/Fortran).\nIndeed, although discarding ugly features will give good impression for existing users of modern Fortran (and increase safety for new users, e.g., against implied save), I am not sure to what extent they contribute to wider adoption if popular large code bases cannot be compiled any more (e.g., with no options provided for legacy modes etc). Also,  I guess that addition of new features are typically more attractive for new users (ideally, something that other languages cannot do easily or simplifies coding very much for the same task).\nAt the same time, I often feel that the name \"Fortran\" has recently a bit negative impression when talking with younger people, and I believe it is crucially important to keep sending the message that it is evolving and also let them know the latest / attractive features of modern Fortran (I am sorry to be a bit off-topic here).\n(Again, I emphasize that the above post is to make a balance, not to claim zero-or-one type thing.)"

All of these codes - without fail - either had\nIMPLICIT INTEGER(I-N), DOUBLE PRECISION (A-H,O-Z)\nor\nIMPLICIT NONE\nFor codes like these with explicit IMPLICIT statements, a future revision of the standard that removes implicit typing as the default should cause no harm!\nSo it'll be really useful to know what other codes are out there which are of concern that Fortran cannot remove implicit typing as the default.  And how relevant will these codes be in year 2035 or later when sufficient number of processors providing support for a revision with such a change start to appear?  Note the earliest possible revision is Fortran 202Y.\nI contend the risk of breaking old code is too low or nonexistent and that's not even taking into account the surefire possibility of vendors providing options to retain implicit typing as the default.

And there are countless coding guidelines and rulesets out there that required its use which clearly shows the practitioners of the language have overwhelmingly desired to move away from implicit typing.  But that the very same processors will adopt options to support the miniscule minority (it it at all exists) who may want to continue employing implicit typing.

Now, I have not pondered over fully in terms of accuracy and the implications but my proposal is the paragraph corresponding to mapping of letters with types in the current standard i.e., 18-007r1 document toward Fortran 2018, Section 8.7 IMPLICIT statement, paragraph 3 be edited as follows:\n[114:29-34]\nChange\n29 3 In each scoping unit, there is a mapping, which may be null, between each of the letters A, B, ..., Z and a\n30   type (and type parameters). An IMPLICIT statement specifies the mapping for the letters in its letter-spec-\n31   list. IMPLICIT NONE with an implicit-none-spec of TYPE or with no implicit-none-spec-list specifies the null\n32   mapping for all the letters. If a mapping is not specified for a letter, the default for a program unit or an interface\n33   body is default integer if the letter is I, J, ..., or N and default real otherwise, and the default for a BLOCK\n34   construct, internal subprogram, or module subprogram is the mapping in the host scoping unit.\n\nto\n29 3 In each scoping unit, there is a mapping, which may be null, between each of the letters A, B, ..., Z and a\n30   type (and type parameters).

Every code one can see on GitHub or SourceForge, etc. either includes or intends to have IMPLICIT NONE in all their scopes.  So this small change of a proposal in this comment is only enabling what is overwhelmingly the practice."

Say we have a function which solves a system of equations for multiple right-hand sides returning the solution in right hand size array. The subroutine might look something like this:\nsubroutine solve(A,b,ierr)\n  real, intent(inout) :: A(:,:)\n  real, intent(inout) :: b(:,:)\n  integer, intent(out) :: ierr\n  ! check shapes match, if not, produce an error flag\n  ! perform factorization of A...\n  ! perform back substitution for columns of b...\nend subroutine\nThis interface is not optimal since, due to the rules of matrix multiplication, we actually know that the number of rows in b should be equal to the number of rows in A. Therefore one might expect it to be possible to use the following interface:\nsubroutine solve(A,b)\n  real, intent(inout) :: A(:,:)\n  real, intent(inout) :: b(size(A,1),:)\n \n  ! perform factorization of A...\n  ! perform back substitution for columns of b from 1 to size(b,2)...\nend subroutine\nThis way we could avoid the need for writing assertion statements to check if the first dimensions of A and B match, and forcing the user to check an error flag. Of course this problem can be avoided completely by using explicit shape arrays, defeating the entire point of having assumed-shape ones. A second (unattractive) option would be to use an assumed-size array, and explicitly pass only the number of columns in b:\nsubroutine solve(A,b,nb)\n  real, intent(inout) :: A(:,:)\n  real, intent(inout) :: b(size(A,1),*)\n \n  ! perform factorization of A...\n  ! perform back substitution for columns from 1 to nb...\nend subroutine\nCould someone perhaps explain what is the reason that the second example above is not allowed and the compiler flags it as a \"bad array specification\"?",

            "text": "Use Cases\nModule name clashes\nIt is very common to have modules named constants.f90, mesh.f90, solver.f90, utils.f90, types.f90, etc. (the modules have the same name as the file name in this example). When writing an application this is not a problem. But when writing a library, one cannot name modules like that, because if the application that uses the library also has constants.f90, then the modules will clash. Pretty much the only solution is to name the modules as libraryname_constants (usually implemented in libraryname_constants.f90).  This is suboptimal, because when the application uses any module from the library, it has to type in the long name (e.g., use libraryname_constants, only: pi).\nDistribution\nWhen you distribute a Fortran library, you have to distribute all modules, which can easily be dozens and dozens of .mod files, which all end up littering your $PREFIX/include.\nSolution\nAllow modules to be nested. In Python, one creates the following directory structure:\nmylib\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 a.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 b.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\nand then one can import files as follows:\n>>> import mylib\n>>> import mylib.a\n>>> import mylib.b\n\nThis particular import will become possible in Fortran with #1, but in the meantime one could do the equivalent of this:\n>>> from mylib import something\n>>> from mylib.a import something\n>>> from mylib.b import something\n\nThis solution fixes both uses cases above. There can be mylib.constants and there will be no name clashes. When the library is distributed, it is installed as:\n$PREFIX/include/mylib.mod\n$PREFIX/include/mylib/a.mod\n$PREFIX/include/mylib/b.mod\n\nPerhaps it could even be:\n$PREFIX/include/mylib/__module__.mod\n$PREFIX/include/mylib/a.mod\n$PREFIX/include/mylib/b.mod\n\nSo there is no littering.\nIssues to resolve\nThe Fortran standard does not talk about files and filesystem. Unless we want to change it, the module nesting feature must be implemented similar to submodules. The exact syntax needs to be figured out.\nWhy not submodules? Submodules unfortunately do not allow to implement the above use case with mylib to be able to import nested modules. With submodules a large Fortran library would have to stop using modules, it would only have one module and lots of small submodules. My understanding is that the submodule can only extend things declared in the main module. So you cannot for example do use mylib%b, only: something. You would have to have something in mylib.f90 itself. This does not scale for large libraries with hundreds of files.\nSyntax: Regarding syntax, probably using % would work, to make it consistent with #1, so the above Python imports would translate to:\nuse, namespace :: mylib\nuse, namespace :: mylib%a\nuse, namespace :: mylib%b\n...\ncall mylib%a%something()\n\nand\nuse mylib, only: something\nuse mylib%a, only: something\nuse mylib%b, only: something\n...\ncall something()",

Based on @klausler's suggestion, I am thinking about something like the following:\n! module without prefix\nmodule level1\n  use, namespace, relative :: level2\nend module level1\n\n! module with prefix\nmodule (level1) level2\ncontains\n  subroutine level2_test()\n  end subroutine level2_test\nend module level1\n\n! module with prefix\nmodule (level1%level2) level3\ncontains\n  interface\n    module subroutine level3_test1()\n    end subroutine level3_test1\n    module subroutine level3_test2()\n    end module subroutine\n  end interface\nend module level3\n\n! submodule\nsubmodule (level1%level2%level3) level3impl\ncontains\n  subroutine level3_test1()\n  end subroutine level3_test1\nend submodule level3impl\n\n! sub-sub-module\nsubmodule (level1%level2%level3:level3impl) level3impl2\ncontains\n  subroutine child_test2()\n  end subroutine child_test2\nend submodule level3impl2\n\n\nprogram test\n  ! Imports level1 as namespace\n  use, namespace :: level1\n  use, namespace :: level1%level2%level3\n\n  call level1%level2%test_level2()\n  call level1%level2%level3%test_level3()\n\nend program test\n\nIt could be realized also without namespaces, if that turns out to be a problem, then it would correspond to the from level1.level2.level3 import * kind of imports in Python."

            "text": "originally proposed by Espen Myklebust in #80\nNew syntax for iterated DO loops\nProposal\nAdd a new syntax for declaring a DO statement loop-control that follows the pattern of modern Fortran. This syntax will be further enhanced with subsequent syntax proposals\nRationale\n\nThe \u201cregular\u201d DO construct index/control specification has a completely different form than the modern Fortran constructs\n\n\nA comma separated list specifying the control variable (instead of a triplet)\na label (legacy from non-block DO)\nno parenthesized expression or specification\n\n\nIt also lacks some additional features of the DO CONCURRENT and FORALL index specifications\nA consistent notation should be pursued\n\n\nextremely helpful when learning the language\n\nProposed syntax\n[do-construct-name :] DO [ ,] FOR( [type-spec ::] index-spec-list [ , scalar-mask-expr] )\n:\nEND DO [do-construct-name]\n\nThis matches the DO CONCURRENT syntax exactly, with the obvious difference in the \u201cDO-keyword.\u201d However, if more than one index variable is specified there must be a rule for determining in which order the indices are incremented, in contrast to the case for a DO CONCURRENT construct where this does not matter. The following rule is suggested:\nThe leftmost index declared is incremented first, then the second leftmost and so on.\nThis is consistent with how the subscript order value increases in array element order which have a pleasant\nimplication when looping through arrays.\nExample\nThe following loop\nDO j=1,m\n  DO i=1,n\n    IF ( i.LT.n .AND. j.LT.m ) THEN\n      a(i,j) = a(i,j) + a(i+1,j+1)\n    END IF\n  END DO\nEND DO\ncould be written much more compactly as\nDO FOR( i=1:n, j=1:m, i.LT.n .AND. j.LT.m )\n  a(i,j) = a(i,j) + a(i+1,j+1)\nEND DO\nIn both loops the indices are specified in the order that should(?) achieve the best performance, but whereas for the present syntax the outermost construct (usually declared first?) must have the last index and the innermost construct the first one, the proposed syntax declares the indices in the same order as they (should!) appear in the array qualifier. This is perhaps a minor detail (that some compilers automatically mend), but in the writers experience, at least beginners and those that are not aware of this, tend to declare the nested loops \u201cin the reverse order.\u201d Of course it would also be possible to maintain the structure of the first code block, only changing the loop-control parts to the new syntax, as shown below\nDO FOR( j=1:m )\n  DO FOR( i=1:n )\n\nComments\n\nThe proposed syntax makes it easy to switch between a CONCURRENT and regular DO by just changing\nthe token, as opposed to having to respecify the whole statement\nCompared to the present \u201clegacy\u201d DO construct it also adds the possibility\n\n\nto declare multiple index/control variables,\ntheir type parameter, and\nfor a mask expression\n\n\nThe token FOR is widely used for this kind of loop\nIn the last code block it could be possible to include the masking expression since the loop control variables would be equally well known to the program as in the middle code block.",

Why not try to avoid any impact on DO construct, the most important and perhaps the most complicated block construct in the language, why not consider this a new FOR construct?\n\n\n   for ( i=1,n; j=1,m; (i < n) .and. (j<m) )\n      a(i,j) = a(i,j) + a(i+1,j+1)\n   end for\n\n\n\nThere appears an unwritten rule in the language with FORALL and DO CONCURRENT constructs that colon notation e.g., 1:n is intended to signal loop iterations in no specified order.  So one might end up needing some change to the syntax, perhaps one that retains the comma as in 1,n but introduces the line separator of semi-colon to separate the loop variables.\n\n\nNow, making the loop variables a construct entity and thus being able to declare them with a <type-spec> is rather important.  However this might be the opportunity to introduce iterators into Fortran, so the loop control needn't be using only an integer variable.\n\n\nLoop control schemes need to be worked out, especially with CYCLE, EXIT.\n\n\nNote though the development of a good set of requirements and specifications for such a construct is the real challenge; syntax is the easy part."

All module files with the language version keyword would be treated accordingly to the specified version.\nAdvantages:\n\nOne could deprecate features much faster without fearing to break backwards compatibility.\nThe user would not have to deal with compiler specific flags to enforce a given practice or language standard (like -assume realloc_lhs or similar). Especially, if you have source files with different language standards in a project (no nice, but can happen), you won't need to fiddle with the compilation options for each file individually.\nA single line could enforce several requirements without too much verbosity, so instead of having\nimplicit none(type, external)\nimplicit save off\nshort_circuiting on\n...\n\none would just write\nlanguage_version 2022\n\nto profit from all the features / requirements a given Fortran standard offers / enforces.\nFinally, its marketing value would tremendous.

The relevance of Fortran in scientific and technical programming is profound and hope it can remain as such, its strength lies in both in its legacy but more importantly with the potential for the future that can allow scientists and technologists to focus almost exclusively on their domain expertise and their computations without having to get their hands \"dirty\" with the nitty-gritty details and artifacts of computer engineering (pointers, LValue/Rvalue, etc.)"

While every programming language has its own peculiarities, those peculiarities should have a good justification other than we always did this way.

So the only question is how to signal to the compiler. Here are the options that I have seen proposed:\n\n\nFile suffix specifying a version (.f90, .f03, .f08, .f18, .f2x, .f2y)\n\n\nCompiler option for the version (-std=f95, -std=f18, -std=f2x)\n\n\nCompiler option for a feature (-frealloc-lhs, -fimplicit-none, ...)\n\n\nKeyword for the version (this issue #83)\n\n\nKeyword for a specific feature (implicit none, implicit save off (see #40), ...)\n\n\nKeyword for modern (modern module X) which would not use obsolete features (features can become obsolete in the future and one would need to update the code)\n\n\nIs there fundamentally any other way to consider?\nAnalysis\nThe option 1. does not seem to be a good way as @sblionel explained here, and I agree.\nThe option 2. is already used in compilers such as gfortran, but my understanding is that the standard does not enforce new features, so even with the latest -std=f18, the feature implicit none is not enabled unless explicitly told so. In other words, the newest standard does not break old code. So the options 1., 2., and 4. actually cannot impose implicit none, unless F202x or F202y introduces a breaking change of enabling implicit none by default, and historically this is not how we have done things. But unless that is changed, you would still have to do:\nlanguage_version 202x\nimplicit none(type, external)\nimplicit save off\nshort_circuiting on\n...\n\nThat leaves options 3. and 5., both of which one can use today, but the problem with these is that as more and more optional features are added, it will be more and more painful to be always explicitly enabling them at the beginning of each module, such as:\nimplicit none(type, external)\nimplicit save off\nshort_circuiting on\n...\n\nThe objection from Steve regarding the fact that the name of the standard changes until it is released is easily fixed by simply using the placeholder -std=f2x, until F202X is released and then changing it to -std=f23 (for X=3). That's how C++ does it and f2x just becomes an alias for f23. I think that's not a problem in practice.\nSo the main issue that I can see in here is that some future standard, say 202y will introduce a breaking change such as enabling implicit none by default. And if you tell the compiler (no matter whether using an option -std=f2y, or by using a keyword language_version 2y), then the new feature will be used by default. That is a fundamentally different way of doing it --- and that's what we should discuss if we want that.\nUpdate: added option 6."

One note on the topic, whether to realize it via compiler option or language construct: I think, a programming language should be self-contained. A compiler should be able to generate correctly behaving code (and stop on standard violation) just by reading the source code itself without the need of any additional hints in form of command line options.

So ugly syntax or not, what I personally get paid for is to get good numeric results.\nConsider the very root of such solutions, which probably is the familiar line\nimplicit none\nThe implicit typing feature was deemed to be unsafe and thus new, stricter rules for typing can be enabled with this switch. Please notice:\n\nif you omit the implicit none, the functionality of the code will not change\nif you use -fimplicit-none (or equivalent) switch, the functionality of the code will not change\n\nReading the code mid-file, you don't need to check the top of the file to see the implicit none. You just use the implicit typing and whether this mode is enabled or not, you will be good. Now if you start using implicit typing and implicit none was in effect, you will get a compiler error. All good.\nNow consider the proposed switch (let's stick to my favorite implicit save). For example:\nimplicit nosave\n\nIf you do that, the behavior of the code will change violently in a completely non-distinguishable way. Whenever you see:\ninteger :: i = 0\n\nyou have no idea whether i will be zero on each call or not. And worst of all, if you make a mistake, you will not be warned.\nNow when you work with different files, some of them written in 1980s, other in 2010s, you cannot just write right Fortran: you have to keep in mind which typing/saving/... rules are in place. Which is exactly the reason why implicit typing was deemed unsafe!\nAs much as I hate and despise this feature, I think we cannot provoke such situations. It must be clear looking at the code whether the variable is save or not. A couple of solutions have been proposed:\n\ninteger, nosave :: i = 0 -- IMO pain to type\ninteger, init :: i = 0 -- nicer to type on QWERTY keyboard\ninteger :: i := 0 -- or some other operator, such as =>. The good side is that there are no keywords that clutter the code.\n\nAny solution must be nice to type. This keyword/syntax will be used a lot. So I personally would prefer some operator-based syntax because having nosave every 3 lines would cause a lot of clutter, especially in editors with syntax highlighting. But the worst case init would be not that much pain.\nNow this ended up being an implicit save post which I didn't intend but I did not know how to split it so maybe I will post exactly the same thing in the other place."

For the first one, I would wish that nearly each standard would deprecate old eventually harmful features, when new more robust alternatives had been introduces. Semantic changes on the other hand should be as rare as possible. For me, having 1-2 changes every 20-25 years would be acceptable (max. 2 changes during my entire professional career from writing the first code as student till being retired at the age of 67), but of course your opinion may differ on this.\nWhen we had a language version keyword, it would cover both kind of changes. If semantic changes happen only every 2 or 3 decades, Fortran practitioners would not have to be language history experts, because a given code line would be warranted to keep its exact meaning/behavior for at least that amount of time. But if such a change happens, the explicit language keyword at the top of the module would make sure, that it still compiles (and behaves) as before without the necessity of vendor dependent compiler switches.\nAdditionally, by specifying the language version at the top of your modules, beginners looking at your modern Fortran projects could immediately realize, that the language constructs used in that code are still considered to be good practice.

The situation is akin to the legendary Gordian knot.  Why not then take an obvious solution from history which is to simply cut the damn thing out?\nAs is, there are crucial differences in syntax (and by extension, I would argue, in semantics) between free-form and fixed source.\nSo what breaking impact and damage is expected if both IMPLICIT typing and implied SAVE are deleted altogether from free-form source?"

I don't see it worthwhile spending time arguing this after so long.\n\nNo, many a new user does not learn to accept this and that's the point.  Trying to get new coders to work on Fortran codes, particularly in industry, is a huge challenge.  Few join with any background in Fortran, few schools teach Fortran.  Then one loses them at 'hello' itself, meaning at the very beginning stage when one stresses to them the need to type 'implicit none' in every scope.\n\nImplicit save is harder - .. this is an integral aspect to the language and I don't see changing it worthwhile. I'd be in favor of adding IMPLICIT (NOSAVE).\n\nTo reiterate, both implicit typing and implied save introduce 'silent errors' (to borrow the term by @gronki), these two aspects are pernicious, they bring tremendous vulnerabilities to Fortran code.  To argue they are integral to the language in year 2019 conveys an entirely wrong message about Fortran.\nSeparately, the added risk that will get introduced with yet another addition to the IMPLICIT statement was mentioned upthread just yesterday by @gronki.  That's what made me think further about using the source form itself has a signal to the compiler.\nI inquire again of the several questions in #83 (comment).\n\nCan anyone point to any code-base using free-form source where \"implicit typing\" is employed per code design?\nCan anyone point to any code-base that explicitly relies on implied SAVE in its code design?"

It's a matter of mindset, a certain openness to adopt FOSS which also enables good sense to be explicit in everything in order to maximize clarity for the widest audience of one's code.\nThe issue is with unverifiable claims about code held privately.  Now I happen to work with a lot of teams in industry who have such 'private/proprietary' code.  If there is one thing I know for sure it is that none of the critical 'private/proprietary' code are going to remain in Fortran for long unless this language keeps apace fully with modern trends and truly enhances type safety and reduces code vulnerabilities, particularly as cloud and parallel computing come to the fore.  Imagine one line somewhere hidden with an implied SAVE also has the potential to cause data race conditions or lock scenarios with the risk of rendering a Fortran library not thread-safe and thus unfit for consumption in a cloud service.\nI too can attest and that is to so many code-bases moving away Fortran permanently.

And implicit none for example is definitely not sexy.\n@certik The comparison with the Python 2 / Python 3 framework holds only partially. By introducing for example a language keyword (OT of this issue \ud83d\ude09 ), all projects would be warranted to compile unchanged till the end of times, as the language keyword (or its absence) would let the compiler know, which backwards incompatible changes it is allowed to consider and which ones not.\nI am not advocating the language keyword as the ultimate solution (explicit all as suggested in  #40 would solve several our current issues as well).

The entire premise of viewing the two as same resides on trivializing the action behind the removal of 2 blanks.\nBut the bothersome aspect here is there is no consistency in such 'courtesy': should one have to port some implicitly typed code in fixed-form to free-form, why not be totally open-minded to the need to perform an 'action' like explicitly declare the variable when one is open to do the same with the supposedly insignificant blanks in one's fixed-form source anyway?

I imagine future Fortranners will laugh back at us Fortran 2018 people at some point too. If I can remember correctly, there are some books that referred to even Fortran 77 (or perhaps 90) as \"modern\" Fortran (in comparison to Fortran IV).\n@gronki wrote:\n\nAnd the reason that I propose this as a part of the language (and not a\ncompiler switch) is that I think standard should be more enforcing about\nnot using old features.\n\nI don't see why the standard should be more enforcing. Aren't we all responsible users? Most modern ;) Fortran books mark these features as obsolescent, meaning that as long as programmers are up to date with the current language standard (much easier with Fortran, than any other programming language I know), these features should not appear in any newly developed codes. If you depend on some old codes you can always use one of the automatic tools to convert it to Fortran 90, or perhaps even refactor it.\nNow, to comment on the actual issue. Something which I find vaguely similar to the proposed language version keyword is the way one can specify the file encoding in Python: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/#defining-the-encoding\nA simple way to get the desired effect would be to have a similar thing, e.g.\n!!! -*- version: Fortran 2060 -*-\nprogram main\n    ! no implicit none needed because explicit typing is now default ;)\n    ...\nend program\nThe way I see it the compiler would then just turn the right language subset compilation flags on and voila."

Please take note that while in the following code:\nsubroutine do_xyz\ninteger :: counter = 0\ninteger :: i\nread (*, *) i\ncounter = counter + i\nyou can kind of forgive what was in mind of those designing it: since variable declarations are in what can be considered a \"header\" of a code block, the value zero is in some way pre-assigned to it before the first execution. Whereas if you declare it mid-code:\nx = y + z\nreal :: w = 0\nw = w + x\nit is quite obvious that in the third line you expect that w = 0. Which, in this case, will be true only in the first call. Thus leading to quietly producing incorrect results.\nI think static/save variables should remain declared in the beginning of the block only. Otherwise it's making the implicit save problem only deeper and more burning.\nAnd I agree with @cmacmackin that probably allowing declaring variables in more places (beginning of if blocks, within the loops, in the do loop header similarly to forall) would probably resolve most of the problems. As long as you can see the declaration on the same screen as assignment it should be good.\nLast but not least, the implicit save feature is so toxic that I would think that committee should consider making an exception from \"backwards compatibility\" argument here. Like forall, this feature never really caught up, but led to lots of confusion and is misleading. Compiler vendors will probably maintain some compatibility mode for the rare customers that use it."

While a few statements (e.g., FORMAT and DATA) can appear in each (at least today), the two parts are almost like distinct programming languages.  Older compilers that perform semantic analysis as they parse would complete the definitions in the symbol table when the parse detected the transition from the specification part to the executable part.\nToday, the only concern that I might raise about intermixing some (which?) specification statements into the executable part is that it would slow down the parser on all codes -- it'll have more possibilities to consider in the execution part.  But wouldn't want to raise such a concern without first prototyping the feature and measuring the performance difference.\nI doubt that it would be prohibitive, and I hope that it's not, because -- at least in the case of type-declation-stmt with a \"no implicit SAVE\" option, such inline usage greatly improves readability of code in other languages.  I consider it a best practice in C++ to always initialize each local variable as I declare it with the value of an expression that usually involve references to other declared and initialized locals, similar to a let or where block in Haskell (apart from ordering).\nSo the potential value of this feature depends on solving the \"implicit SAVE due to initialization\" problem, since it seems less useful absent initializers on the intermixed declarations.  I suggest that a combined proposal be drafted.\nI'm not sure it helps much to allow other specification statements to leave the specification-part."

Would the declaration statement be directly above the do loop, or on the same line like do integer i = 1, n? Perhaps fit it in the newly suggested modern do, i.e.  do (integer :: i, j: i=1:n, j=1:m) construct (see #85)?\nWhile I agree this is one of the features I like most from C++, like @sblionel  suggested, in Fortran it can already be done with the  block construct (I found some nice examples here).

This document specifies that the processor-dependent negative\n28    integer value shall be different from the named constants IOSTAT_EOR or IOSTAT_END from the intrinsic\n29    module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.\n30 3  Fortran 2008 permitted a noncontiguous array that was supplied as an actual argument corresponding to a\n31    contiguous INTENT (INOUT) dummy argument in one iteration of a DO CONCURRENT construct, without\n32    being previously defined in that iteration, to be defined in another iteration; this document does not permit this.\n   4  Fortran 2008 permitted\n1     a pure statement function to reference a volatile variable, and permitted a local variable\n2     of a pure subprogram or of a BLOCK construct within a pure subprogram to be volatile (provided it was not\n3     used); this document does not permit that.\n4 5   Fortran 2008 permitted a pure function to have a result that has a polymorphic allocatable ultimate component;\n5     this document does not permit that.\n6 6   Fortran 2008 permitted a PROTECTED TARGET variable accessed by use association to be used as an initial7\n      data-target; this document does not permit that.\n8 7   Fortran 2008 permitted a named constant to have declared type LOCK_TYPE, or have a noncoarray potential\n9     subobject component with declared type LOCK_TYPE; this document does not permit that.\n10 8  Fortran 2008 permitted a polymorphic object to be finalized within a DO CONCURRENT construct; this docu11\n      ment does not permit that.\n12 9  Fortran 2008 permitted an unallocated allocatable coarray or coindexed object to be allocated by an assignment\n13    statement, provided it was scalar, nonpolymorphic, and had no deferred type parameters; this document does\n14    not permit that.\n15 10 Fortran 2008 permitted the processor to use a common pseudorandom number generator for all images. This\n16    document requires separate seeds on each image for the pseudorandom number generator.\n\nSo what it appears to me is an inconsistency in how the \"backward compatibility\" argument is applied and perhaps even an inaccuracy in the argument \"oh, that will break existing code and that is a no-no\" that is put forth.\nIt'll be valuable for Fortran if a technical approach to address the bugaboo of backward compatibility can be adopted.\nOne aspect of such an approach might involve the establishment of a \"registry\" of Fortran codebases: such a registry only need to have links to existing projects online such as GitHub, SourceForge, etc. or to institutional sites e.g., DOE, NASA, NOAA, academia, etc., or simply be entries which provide a brief description of what code does and the coding styles adopted per true intent e.g., the use of IMPLICIT typing (as opposed IMPLICIT NONE), or IMPLICIT SAVE, data types, and so forth.  This can a \"green\" registry of course, meaning it should grow as new applications are developed using Fortran.\nThen when a proposal is presented, one can crosscheck it against such a registry for impact analysis  (and where possible like with GitHub or online repositories with a code review) to yield a somewhat quantitative assessment of the risk due to the change; this is as opposed to someone's 'gut feel' at present which might be overestimating the adverse impact of a proposal.",

Rather than fix their code, they want a switch to revert to the old behavior. If the existing code was non-conforming, I have little sympathy, but the cases where a standard change breaks code are rare. Most of the cases mentioned in the text you quote are where the earlier standard was silent about some combination of uses.  Changing the kind that an intrinsic returns, as has been suggested in #72 , would break code that used these intrinsics as actual arguments.\nRegistry of code libraries is a non-starter. Keep in mind that the usages you see are like the part of an iceberg above water - the vast majority of code is kept privately by organizations loathe to make changes.\nWhether you like it or not, a major strength of Fortran is that, by and large, standard revisions have not broken existing code bases, allowing the vast extent of code libraries to continue to be used."

That latter part is important.  Sometimes target architectures differ from each other or evolve in place in ways that require some porting of codes.  In those situations, compilers (especially from hardware vendors) are going to want to ease the porting, and the standard should assist both coders and implementors with features that maximize and maintain portability.\nHere's a specific example.  Let's say that Big DOE Lab has a code that runs great on 32-bit x86 systems.  When recompiled with a new compiler for 32-bit x86, it should just work, everything else being equal.  And maybe that's enough for that code & customer.  When recompiled for 64-bit x86 targets, if that's desired, it'll probably need some porting so that the larger address space can be exploited to serve larger sets of data.  What features make that porting effort easiest on the customer?  That's the question that should be driving the designs and standards."

Processors can get the details wrong which negatively impact users in terms of time and lost productivity or worse.  And many a user does find the whole notion with implicit typing in Fortran very confusing which further affects the adoption of the language.\nModern programming languages try to be rigorously type-safe and/or dynamically-typed.  But implicit typing is something almost all of them avoid.  But Fortran can choose to ignore the gathering wisdom of modern practitioners and continue to supporting IMPLICIT statements where, users can use such a facility to introduce implicit typing in their scopes and be responsible for their actions.\nBut what is pernicious is the continued support for implicit typing in Fortran as the **default**.\nThen to expect any and all users to circumvent such a default only by introducing \"IMPLICIT NONE\" in all their scopes is truly \"cruel and unusual punishment\".  It's one aspect that this language needs to shed - pronto."

In fact, organizations are encouraged to keep their code bases more maintainable and ensure continuity of knowledge because of the occasional breaking changes that occur in those languages. It seems a lack of backwards compatibility can actually be a virtuous cycle keeping your users in a better position.\nI fear that Fortran's commitment to backwards compatibility at (practically) any cost has actually lead its users down a dangerous path to a precarious position. Eventually one of two things will happen:\n\nIt will no longer be possible to make changes to the language any more and it will die, forcing organizations to rewrite code that they no longer understand\nA feature will come along that is worth breaking backwards compatibility, forcing organizations to fix code that they no longer understand\n\nIn my opinion, the sooner this happens the better, because it will only cost more the longer we wait. It's like continuing to spend on a credit card while only making the minimum payments. Eventually the introductory rate runs out or you hit your limit and you're really up a creek.

It seems it actually satisfies what @klausler wants.\nFor example, for current (old) code, if the version specifier is not specified, then the standard can say that it means the code implicitly assumes Fortran 202X. If you want to use features from a later Fortran standard (say 202Y), you have to put the version specifier in, such as \"edition Fortran 202Y\". However, the minute you put in \"edition Fortran 202Y\", it can break the code (say implicit save becomes implicit init).\nThis proposal has the following features:\n\n\nOld code will continue working unmodified indefinitely.\n\n\nIf you put in \"edition 202Y\" then the old code will break, and it will have to be updated to work again. We should obviously try to provide automatic tools to update the code and excellent error messages to help update old code, good guidelines and we should only introduce breaking features that have a good \"upgrade path\" that can be done with big legacy codes. This would be file by file based, so it could be done incrementally.\n\n\nLater on it can become an error not to specify the \"edition\" keyword. In that case, simply put \"edition 202X\" into old code and it will continue working umodified. Compilers can add an option such as \"-legacy\" that would assume \"edition 202X\". This point 3. might not be implemented in the standard. To me an acceptable solution would be that compilers would give warnings if \"edition\" is not specified, and you can turn off the warning with a compiler option."

I've written some on this topic already, but here are some more thoughts...\n\n\nDeleting features is worse than pointless, it is harmful. Compilers will not actually remove \"deleted\" features because too many of their users/customers will raise a stink if they suddenly have to rewrite code that has worked for years/decades. Or, worse, the users will just switch to another compiler that hasn't removed support. And by \"remove\" I include complaining about it by default and requiring some sort of build option to bring it back. From the standard's perspective, deleting features is harmful as it removes descriptions of how the deleted feature should work with other parts of the language.\n\n\nWhen people ask me what Fortran's strengths are, I always include its compatibility with a broad catalog of existing software, and that a (correct) program written in the 1960s probably compiles, builds and runs just fine in today's compilers. Yes, there are exceptions to this, but they generally relate to rarely used or inadequately specified features.\n\n\nMost of the discussions here of candidates for deletion are about fixed-form source, implicit typing and implicit SAVE. Fixed-form is already marked obsolescent, but it is still VERY widely used. Implicit typing is also very widely used in older codes, but the standard provides a simple way of removing it through IMPLICIT NONE, and compilers have options to default to that - I don't see the need to do more. Implicit SAVE is a much harder thing to remove, as it is a semantic behavior not a syntax, so a compiler could not detect whether the user intended SAVE semantics or not. I'd have no objections to adding SAVE to the F18 IMPLICIT NONE() list, requiring positive action on the part of the user. (Don't forget that DATA has implied SAVE since forever...)\n\n\nI do not agree with those who argue that backwards compatibility prevents new features from being added. As I have already written, it can affect how we specify the new feature.\nLast, I'm puzzled and disappointed at all the energy being devoted to this general topic, which I view as being a silly hill to die on. But I'm done here and will be interested in what J3 folk have to say about it next month."

At the same time, the new language could provide some directive to compile a given source with a \"traditional mode\" (e.g., \"legacy\" or \"unsafe\" directive at the top of a file).

            "text": "A proposal from UK national body from year 2013: https://wg5-fortran.org/N1951-N2000/N1975.txt\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNumber: UK-01\nTitle: Default KINDs for constants and intrinsics\nStatus: For Consideration\nBasic Functionality:\nProgram-specified default KIND for constants etc.\nRationale:\n(a) In the 64-bit world default integer generally being 32-bit is\n    increasingly leading to incorrect programs.\n(b) In the floating-point world default real generally being 32-bit\n    not infrequently leads to incorrect programs.\n(c) It is tedious and error-prone to have to attach kind_param's to\n    individual literal constants.\n(d) It is tedious and error-prone to have to specify a KIND= argument as\n    required for each individual reference to an intrinsic function.\n(e) Program specification of the default type parameters is possible for\n    derived types but not intrinsic types.\n\nSpecification (requirements):\n1. Provide a mechanism for specifying the default kind parameter for the\n   intrinsic types REAL and INTEGER.\n2. Decouple the concepts of \"default kind\" from those of \"single precision\"\n   and \"basic integer\"; \"default kind\" to be used for literal constants,\n   implicit typing, etc., while \"single precision\" et al to be used for the\n   old storage association contexts.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nSpecifications (detailed):\n--------------------------\na. There will be a new statement, that can appear only between the USE\n   statements and IMPLICIT statements, to specify the default kind for a\n   particular intrinsic type.\nb. The effect of this statement is to change the default kind for the\n   remainder of the scoping unit.  To avoid circular dependencies, it does\n   not affect the default kind of literals appearing in or before the\n   statement itself, nor does it affect the type implied by a PARAMETER\n   statement that appears before the statement.\n   Rationale: circular dependencies bad, named constants good.\nc. The default kind setting in a scoping unit is initially that of its\n   host scoping unit; note that as nested scoping units appear necessarily\n   after any IMPLICIT statements, this will inherit the user setting.\nd. In the case of REAL, the default kind for COMPLEX is also affected.\n   It does not affect double precision kind, which remains as twice single\n   precision in storage.\ne. Terminology:\n     \"default kind\" = user-specifiable default kind\n     \"single precision kind\" = old default real kind\n     \"basic integer kind\" = old default integer kind\nf. OPTIONAL: There is a reasonable argument to be made that permitting the\n   user to specify the kind for \"double precision\" constants and variables\n   would also be valuable.\ng. Table of places where \"default kind\" is used, and what that should\n   correspond to in the new scheme, follows.\n\n    Context                                         Should be\n    ---------------------------------------------------------\n(1) integer literal with no <kind-param>            default kind\n(2) \"kindly\" intrinsics with absent KIND=           default kind * Note T0\n(3) intrinsics with no KIND argument                default kind * Note T1\n(4) <type-spec> with no KIND parameter, e.g. REAL   default kind * Note T2\n(5) arguments to generic intrinsics                 accept both * Note T3\n(6) args/result for specific intrinsics, e.g. AMIN1 basic kind * Note T4\n(7) constants in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV                    basic kind * Note T5\n(8) having the size of one numeric storage unit     basic kind\n(9) EQUIVALENCE/COMMON real/integer matching        basic kind\n\nNote T0.\n  This includes LBOUND, LCOBOUND, SIZE, SHAPE ... i.e. all the ones that\n  have a KIND= argument and return a REAL/INTEGER/COMPLEX result of the\n  specified kind when present, and default kind when not.\n\nNote T1.\n  Actually these don't really matter much, as the value always fits into\n  basic kind.  However, it would be more convenient when passing as an\n  actual argument, and more consistent, for these to be the new\n  user-specifiable default kind too.  Here is a representative list of\n  the intrinsics concerned: DIGITS, PRECISION, RANGE, EXPONENT,\n  MAX_EXPONENT, and THIS_IMAGE.\n\nNote T2.\n  Wherever the <type-spec> is, viz a type declaration statement, component\n  definition statement, array constructor, etc.\n\nNote T3.\n  The affected intrinsics:arguments are DATE_AND_TIME: VALUE,\n  EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE:EXITSTAT,CMDSTAT, GET_COMMAND:LENGTH,STATUS, and\n  similar.  Not a big deal (values always representable in the basic kind)\n  but why not relax the requirement to permit larger kinds always anyway?\n\nNote T4.\n  Not actually important.  These are wholly redundant anyway.\n\nNote T5.\n  As if it were a user-defined module with those constants.\n\nSyntax (illustrative):\n----------------------\n   DEFAULT <intrinsic-type-name> ( [ KIND = ] <int-constant-expr> )\n     where <intrinsic-type-name> is INTEGER or REAL.\n   Cnnn (Ryyy) The kind number specified in a DEFAULT INTEGER statement\n     shall specify a kind whose storage size is at least as great as that\n     of basic integer kind.\n   {Reason: To stop the user shooting his foot off with a short integer\n            kind.}\n\n   OPTIONAL: If we permit specification of double precision kind, add this\n             additional syntax:\n   DEFAULT DOUBLE PRECISION ( [ KIND = ] <int-constant-expr> )\n   Cnnn The kind number specified in a DEFAULT DOUBLE PRECISION\n     statement shall not specify a kind whose storage size is less than\n     that of default real kind.\n   {Reason: There might not be a bigger real kind than the user-specified\n            default, but it would be counter-intuitive to permit\n            specification of a double precision kind that is actually\n            smaller than default real.}\n\nExample:\n--------\nThis is just to show how it works, it is too trivial to show much\nadvantage.\n\nProgram sum_tan_prefix\n  Default Integer (Kind=Selected_Int_Kind(18))\n  Default Real (Kind=Selected_Real_Kind(15))\n  Real,Allocatable :: x(:)\n  Print *,'Input vector length N'\n  Read *, n\n  If (n<2) Stop 'Don''t be silly.'\n  Allocate(x(n))\n  Print *,'Input vector with',Size(x),'values in degrees'\n  Read *,x\n  tmp = 0\n  Print *,'SUM_TAN_PREFIX results'\n  Do i=1,Size(x)\n    tmp = tmp + Tan(x(i)*3.1415926535897932384/180)\n    Print *,i,x\n  End Do\nEnd Program",

Subprograms with long argument lists (thus the case of \"many variables like this\") are best avoided as-is, but then if the argument list includes \"groups of optional dummy arguments\" the situation is questionable.\n\n\n\"Using derived types also works for some cases but may be unsatisfactory or not possible for others.\" - well, if the use of derived types is \"unsatisfactory or not possible\" but instead a library designer is dealing with \"many variables like this of the same type grouped into different sets\" that are optional, again something appears amiss with code design."

Maybe this algorithm has lots of input parameters. Some of them are optional, some of them only make sense when used together. I don't think it's bad practice to have the constructor just have a lot of inputs. It makes it very easy for the user of this library to instantiate the class like so:\n type(trajectory_optimization_method) :: t\n call t%initialize(method=encke, relative_tol=1.0e-6, absolute_tol=1.0e-9, &\n    event_function=my_func, event_tol=1.0e-12, event_method=brent, etc...)\n call t%go(...)\nMaybe in this made up example, the event ones have to be used together (either not present, or all present). Sure, I could force the user to declare another type with these variables and then that's the single optional argument. But it does make it more verbose for the user, since they now have to declare another class & instantiate it.  Now imagine there are multiple groups of variables like this for the algorithm.\nAnyway, not really a huge deal.

Now, if as you write it proves 'more verbose for the user, since they now have to declare another class & instantiate it' then for such situations OO class designs do tend to adopt additional 'setter' methods that are invoked only as needed:\n type(trajectory_optimization_method) :: t\n call t%initialize(method=encke, relative_tol=1.0e-6, absolute_tol=1.0e-9)\n call t%setevent( event_function=my_func, event_tol=1.0e-12, event_method=brent )\n ! other such setters\n call t%go(...)\n\nAnyways, I assume you have seen in other languages the kind of facilities you have in mind toward managing groups of optional parameters in subprogram invocations?

Actually, since the introduction of the norm2() function, it is already part the language.\nIs there a showcase, where anyone can demonstrate the necessity of variadic routines and show, that it would be impossible or very inconvenient to implement the same functionality using arrays and/or optional arguments?

A procedure without any optional arguments could have zero or one argument with the attribute variadic. There would be two additional intrinsic procedures defined, similar to those used for getting command line arguments: get_variadic_count and get_variadic_argument. The first of these would return the number of variadic arguments passed to the function. The second would make the argument specified as variadic point to the desired argument. Their interfaces would be as follows:\nfunction get_variadic_count()\n  integer :: get_variadic_count\nend function\n\nsubroutine get_variadic_argument(number, value, status)\n  integer, intent(in) :: number\n  type(*), dimension(..), intent(out) :: value\n  integer, intent(out), optional :: status\nend subroutine\nAs an example, I'll show how these could be used for an implementation of max that works on rank-1 arrays:\nfunction array_max(arrays)\n  integer, dimension(:), intent(in), variadic :: arrays\n  integer :: array_max\n  integer :: i, j, n\n  n = get_variadic_count()\n  do i = 1, n\n    call get_variadic_argument(i, arrays)\n    if ( i == 1) array_max = arrays(1)\n    do j = 1, size(arrays)\n      if (arrays(j) > array_max) array_max = arrays(j)\n    end do\n  end do\nend function array_max\nThe advantage of can see of this is that the variadic argument could support pass-by-reference, with the compiler implementing it as a pointer in the background. It would avoid the need to copy the individual arguments into a new array. It would allow enforcing all of the arguments to be of the same type/kind/rank but not necessarily the same size. There would also be nothing to stop the variadic argument being declared as unlimited polymorphic, assumed type, or assumed rank, in which case each argument would not necessarily need to be the same type/rank, but the usual type-guards would be needed before you could do anything interesting with the argument. This approach would also allow for all the usual attributes (intent, pointer, allocatable, etc.) to be applied to the variadic argument in a meaningful way."

That's nearly 30 years now.  And there are quite a few processor implementations where the KINDs are not unique.  So it appears infeasible now, in addition to being of limited value, to include something like this in the standard."

With that in mind, my hope is one should be simply be able to do the following with no risks or dangers in terms of type, kind mismatch and any consequent loss of precision, etc.:\n! The scoping unit for the statement below shall be able to state the KIND for the\n! literal is the same as that of the named constant\nfp64, parameter :: myconst = 0.1234\n\nI do think Fortran needs to advance beyond the _wp kind of suffix/prefix in literal constants."

The problem with changing the default behavior is that it would break some existing programs, which is almost always a killer.\nOne might think that implementations would start shifting default integer from 32 to 64 bits much the way that it changed from 16 to 32 bits in the late 70s. (I am ignoring old platforms with 36, 48 and 60-bit word sizes.)  But then you run into the issue @klausler originally noted that this would also change the size of default REAL, and I don't think people are ready for that.\nOffhand, I am not in favor of any proposal that adds a new implicit behavior. I understand that dealing with constants of non-default kind can be messy, and things such as SIZE can be problematic, but the programmer already needs to be aware when an array might exceed a default integer extent, and use larger kind integers throughout the code.\nI know this general topic was discussed when the KIND arguments were added, but I can't find details in the 2014 papers."

And if  f18 is adopting \"intentional violations of the standard\", then there must be users out there concerned about this, those who rather prefer a new processor such as f18 to adopt strict consistency with the standard by default.  Now of course when an implementation feels strongly about certain stipulations in the standard, it can separately offer its users an alternate path forward,say an option to pursue another dialect e.g., how GCC/gfortran does with -std='gnu'."

            "text": "One very common use case for a preprocessor is a custom ASSERT macro, that is empty in Release mode, but in Debug mode it checks the condition and prints out the filename and line number. As discussed in #65, Fortran is moving away from a preprocessor, and so by adding an assert statement into the language would eliminate one more use case for a preprocessor.\nFrom a user perspective, the syntax can be something like:\ninteger :: i\ni = 5\nassert(i == 5)\nIn Release mode, the assert would do nothing, in Debug mode the assert would evaluate the condition (e.g., i == 5) and if it fails, it would print a nice stacktrace. This would be a much better behavior than the current practice, where typically the ASSERT macro only prints a filename+line, but not a full stacktrace, so it can be hard to figure out why it happened.",

Later, character literals were allowed as formats, which brought us to the following:\nprint '(\"important parameter = \", f6.1, \" for n = \", i3)', 9.5, 11\nthis would be good if not the fact that github, like all text editor I've worked with, display the entire format in string color. If that was not bad enough, you need to use different kind of quotes inside the format than to enclose the character literal, and you have to remember which one you used.\nMy proposal is to introduce something to distinguish between format strings and other strings. Internally they could be handled the same, but text editors would be able to highlight .\n\nOption 1: use apostrophes ``. The downside is that they are difficult to distinguish from single quotes, but some languages (like MySQL) actually do use them. Alternatively, other characters could be used, like // (whatever doesn't conflict with already existing syntax). Example: \nprint `(\"important parameter = \", f6.1, \" for n = \", i3)`, 2.4, 3 \nprint /(\"important parameter = \", f6.1, \" for n = \", i3)/, 2.4, 3\nOption 2: revive format as \"function\". The downside is that its quite a long word and would not be very clear when used directly in print/write/read. Example: \ncharacter(len = *), parameter :: fmt = format(\"important parameter = \", f6.1, \" for n = \", i3)\nOption 3: use character prefix, similarly to z being used for hex numbers. The downside is that you still have to escape the quotes. Example: \nprint f'(\"important parameter = \", f6.1, \" for n = \", i3)', 2.4, 3\n\nYes, this is syntactic sugar, but it is something that compilers just need to allow (does not introduce new rules into the language) but makes life of the developers much easier.\nallow format without parethesis\nconsider the following:\nprint '(3i3)', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nOf course, the output will be\n  1  2  3\n  4  5\n\nNow, in 99% of the cases the repetition of the format will never occur as the number of arguments matches the number of format fields. Therefore, parethesis () only obfuscate the syntax. I propose the following format (currently invalid):\nprint '3i3', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nwould produce the output:\n  1  2  3\n\nIn that case, our example would be along the lines of\nprint '\"important parameter = \", f6.1, \" for n = \", i3', 9.5, 11\nprint /\"important parameter = \", f6.1, \" for n = \", i3/, 9.5, 11\n\nObviously, not all of them look very good, but there are many choices here that can be made to improve readability.\nallow character literals in input formats\nthis was discussed in comp.lang.fortran. Yet, I still think it is worth considering as it is a simple thing (also to implement) that would increase the functionality of the language.\nConsider the following code:\ninteger i\nreal f\n\n666 format (\"important parameter = \", f6.1, \" for n = \", i3)\n667 format (22x, f6.1, 9x, i3)\n\nread (*, *) f, i\nopen (33, status = 'scratch')\nwrite (33, 666) f, i\nrewind (33)\n! note: we have to use 667 format instead of 666\nread (33, 667) f, i\nclose(33)\n\nprint 666, f, i\n\nend\nIn action:\n$ gfortran test.f90 && ./a.out\n3 3\nimportant parameter =    3.0 for n =   3\n\nAs you can see, a whole new format 667 needs to be constructed to read the data written with format 666. That deprecates the whole idea of separating formatting from data. In this case, I have written a simple function that replaces any character literal within the format with Nx when N is the length of that literal. But I see no reason why this could not be handled internally by the compiler, reducing complexity of maintaining two formats (for write and read). There are two options how this could be done:\n\nOption 1: simply treat any character literal as Nx, where N is the length of that literal\nOption 2: read next N characters into a hidden variable and compare with what's in the format, throwing an error if these sequences do not match.\n\nExample in C:\n#include <string.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid main() {\n\nint d, r;\nconst char fmt1[] = \"wolf has %5d sheep\\n\";\nconst char fmt2[] = \"sheep is %5d kilos\\n\";\nchar buf[128];\n\nscanf(\"%d\", &d);\n\nsprintf(buf, fmt1, d);\n\nd = 0;\nr = sscanf(buf, fmt1, &d);\nprintf(fmt1, d);\nprintf(\"sscanf exited with %d\\n\", r);\n\nd = 0;\nr = sscanf(buf, fmt2, &d);\nprintf(fmt2, d);\nprintf(\"sscanf exited with %d\\n\", r);\n\n}\nresult:\n$ gcc test.c && ./a.out\n7\nwolf has     7 sheep\nsscanf exited with 1\nsheep is     0 kilos\nsscanf exited with 0\n\nAs you can see, when wrong format was used, sscanf returned 0 which means that 0 variables has been assigned their value.\nAs far as I know there should be no conflict with legacy code as character constants were not allowed in formats before.\nsummary\nThese are just a few ideas. I think there are many more possible simple improvements to Fortran formatted i/o, I think they can be collected in this thread and then the best ones extracted in clean and polished version.\nDominik",

            "title": "Mods to support refactoring legacy codes to remove GO TO",
            "text": "Over the last few months, I've gone through the process of \"depastafying\" some old codes with the goal to remove all instances of GO TO. I did this because in many cases deconstructing the code was the only way I could figure what it was doing. In a large percentage of cases, the GO TOs are used in cases where we would today use IF-THEN-ELSE-ENDIF blocks and the modifications are straightforward. In other cases where you have interlacing branch-backwards, branch-forward GO TOs that iterate through blocks of code, I've found that combinations of unindexed DO, the BLOCK construct and internal subroutines are needed. Finally, the third most frequent use of GO TOs is to jump out of an iteration directly to output statements that print error or other information prior to exiting or stopping. Based on this experience, I've come up with a few modifications that I think would be helpful for those as foolish as me that feel the need to exteriminate GO TO in all its forms.\nFirst, I would like to propose a new construct I call an ITERATION that combines the functionality of BLOCK and unindexed DOs into a single construct. Currently, you can exit BLOCK but not CYCLE it. Unindexed DO allows both.  Just about every Fortran code ever written will have the\nfollowing code fragment;\nInteger :: reccount = 0\n10 Read(7, ('(A)'). ERR=20, END=30) buf\n! Translate buf to something\nreccount = reccount + 1\nGO TO 10\n20 Print something\nRETURN\n30 Print EOF message\n My mod would replace this with\nREADLOOP: ITERATION\n Integer :: ioval\n Integer :: reccount = 0\n Character(LEN=80) :: buffer\n Read(7, '(A)', IOSTAT=ioval) buffer\n If (ioval /= 0) EXIT READLOOP\n\nEnd ITERATION READLOOP\nThis is a simple example but the utility of it really becomes clear when you have to use a BLOCK statement around a large block of code just to handle exiting out of the enclosed BLOCK to some error handling code (usually selected by a SELECT CASE parameter set prior to exiting the BLOCK). I know that this replicates current capabilities by I've always felt that unindexed DO was a poor syntax choice  (one of many syntax \"crimes\" I believe were made by prior committes and have to date gone unpunished)\nIn addition, I would like to implement an EXIT_TO clause in all the named constructs (DO, BLOCK, etc) that allows you to jump directly to another named construct. The constraint is unlike GO TO it can only jump to the beginning of a block of code contained in another named construct\nExample\nDo i=1,n\nIf (error_detected) EXIT_TO error_output\nEnd Do\n! lots of lines of code inbetween\nerror_output: Block\n! process error code etc\nEnd Block error_output\nFinally, if we still have a need for statement labels, at least let them be fully alphanumeric instead of just numbers. This would make them a lot more readable. In particular, I would like to be able to assign a meaningful label to FORMAT statements that reflect what they are doing.\nExample\nWrite (7,threeReals) a, b, c\n\nthreeReals: Format(3(f10.5))\nI know you can do the same using character strings but for the target application( refactoring old code) I think this would be a useful feature.\nI can supply examples of real code where I've use both BLOCK and unindexed DO to remove GO TO if that would help\nAnother reason for proposing these is a hope that some enterprising young person in search of a Masters or Ph.D. thesis topic will develop some open source refactoring tools based on AI/Deep Learning that can remove Go Tos automatically. Maybe a Google Summer of Code project. These constructs would give the refactoring tools something to convert the old code into.\nJust some ideas based on recent experience",

Besides the exception handling use case, an EXIT_TO appears no different than a GO TO and given your title and description, it appears something which is better avoided,  Also, it is unclear how any limited \"GO TO\" in the form of an EXIT_TO construct can make refactoring any more accurate or easier, if you can show an actual refactoring tool (Python script. etc.) that might help make your case.\nNow, re: your case, as you know you will get steered toward named constants or CHARACTER variables generally as FORMAT strings:\n   ..\n   character(len=*), parameter :: UnlimitedReals = \"(*(f10.5))\"\n   ..\n   Write (7, UnlimitedReals) a, b, c\n\nSo my hunch is a major \"selling\" effort on your part will be necessary to get committee's attention on such aspects."

            "title": "Permit namelist character delimiters to default to quotes",
            "text": "Currently there is a somewhat paradoxical issue related to namelist support, where a namelist produced by WRITE() and using the default DELIM value of None does not conform to the namelist specification when it contains a character array.\nA namelist as described in F2018 requires that all character arrays be delimited with single or double quotes (13.11.3.3 p7):\n\nWhen the next effective item is of type character, the input form consists of a sequence of zero or more rep-chars whose kind type parameter is implied by the kind of the corresponding list item, delimited by apostrophes or quotes.\n\nHowever, the default value of DELIM=None will produce a namelist without delimiters (i.e. space-delimited).  From 13.11.4.2 p1:\n\nValues in namelist output records are edited as for list-directed output (13.10.4).\n\nIf we go back to 13.10.4, it highlights three forms of character array output based on DELIM, with NONE being the default.  In other words, the default is incompatible with the namelist format.\nNote 1 of 13.11.4.2 clarifies this point:\n\nNamelist output records produced with a DELIM= specifier with a value of NONE and which contain acharacter sequence might not be acceptable as namelist input records.\n\nIn practice, this is often not a problem, and a robust parser can usually resolve the non-delimited strings if whitespace can act as a delimiter.  But it becomes a more problematic, if not impossible, if the string contains a lexical token, such as &, =, or /.  For example, strings containing paths are almost guaranteed to cause problems.\nTo summarize, a namelist containing character arrays when written with DELIM=NONE does not conform to the namelist specification, and a compiler can not read its own namelist if DELIM is not set to either QUOTE or APOSTROPHE.\nCurrently, gfortran ignores this requirement and defaults to using quote (\") delimiters.  Intel Fortran does not, and will produce a namelist that it cannot read.\n\nWhile this particular problem can be avoided by requiring the programmer to use DELIM for all namelist output (e.g. DELIM='QUOTE'), it will inevitably cause problems for the less experience developer, and could lead to output with errors.\nI'd like to propose that this problem be address in some way.  Two possible solutions:\n\n\nRequire that that DELIM be set for a namelist input, and DELIM='QUOTE' or DELIM=APOSTROPHE) when writing a namelist.  If WRITEis called with aNMLargument and withoutDELIM`, then it is an error.\n\n\nFollow GFortran and silently use DELIM='QUOTE' (or APOSTROPHE) when the output is a namelist.\n\n\nThere may be others possible solutions.\nThis is not a problem that needs to be solved, since users could just be trained to use DELIM when writing namelists.  But I believe that this change would be an improvement in usability and would help to avoid future errors.\n\nThis was prompted by the following discussion on the Intel forums:\nhttps://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-fortran-compiler/topic/831685#comment-1947391",

This may be done only for a very important reason, and a convenience issue, such as a default setting, likely does not rise to that level.\n\n\nThe default will also affect list-directed transfers, which is likely unintended, and will be surprising to list-directed users.  This also argues that a very good reason will be required to overcome the desire not to break programs.\n\n\nNote that one may set the delim value via the OPEN statement or the specific transfer (read/write print) statement in question. The ease of setting the desired behavior per connection or per transfer argues that we not proceed with a change like this one.  As a changeable mode, delim may be set and reset as needed via the initial OPEN and (re)OPEN statements.\nAlso, we have added several features included in the last several revisions of the standard to help input/output of csv records.  Specifically, the unlimited format item allows writing \"item [separator item] ...\" style records. Including a g data edit descriptor in the unlimited format item can treat different types (perhaps when a derived type has had a new component added, for example). The new f202x SPLIT intrinsic operates similarly to strtok(), and helps decode csv records read into a (possibly long) character entity.\nThese are my interpretation of JoR's conclusions and not J3's, nor WG5's.

If the NML= is absent, and the output is list-directed, then the default DELIM from OPEN() (or perhaps WRITE()) would be respected.\nSo I feel that there ought to be a solution which does not affect list-directed input.  In fact, given that GFortran is already doing this, it is proof that there is a way to implement this which does not affect list-directed output.\nIn other words, I am requesting that the non-compliant GFortran behavior become the standard behavior.\nNot sure if there's any constructive way to relay this feedback, so perhaps I am just talking to the air.

If so, then I think that the current wording might be OK to leave list-directed output unaffected?\n\nI haven't thought much about your conclusion, but the first part of your statement is correct; it is the case that the compiler can distinguish a namelist write ([NML=]group) from a list-directed write([FMT=]*)."

But I do consider it a concern when two very simple commands:\nopen(5, file=some_path)\nwrite(5, nml=some_nml) my_data\n\nproduces a thing which is almost - but not quite - a namelist.

It was under consideration for Fortran 202X but WG5 resolved at the Tokyo meeting this past August not to include it in Fortran 202X.  It is now unclear when, if ever, Exception Handling will be standardized in Fortran.\nHowever the concept remains important and perhaps the FOSS and user community can take the lead in distilling further the needs, in ironing out the wrinkles, also \"smoothing\" out the edge cases that can possibly cause \"bleeding\" either in terms of performance or added vulnerabilities in programs, and may be even prototype ideas in implementations such as LFortran, etc.",

Can you show a simple procedure and two calls (once where error is handled and once where it is unhandled)? How to guarantee that the execution of the program will stop if the error is unhandled? ..\n\nThere are no guarantees with anything but nominally the following might be a rough \"template\" on how the concept of ALTERNATE RETURNs can be employed by implementations to mimic Exception Handling like the TRY-CATCH constructs.\nSay there is a library subprogram with a 'contracted' interface that operates on a dummy argument of real type 'x' that is discovered to encounter an exception for values in a certain range of x.  The library code can refactor the method to issue an ERROR STOP and hope the caller can deal with the consequences:\n   subroutine sub_x( x )\n      real, intent(inout) :: x\n      ! An arbitrary range that causes an exception\n      if ( (x > 0.4).and.(x < 0.6) ) then\n         error stop \"In sub_x: invalid value of x\"\n      end if\n      x = x + 1.0\n      return\n   end subroutine\n\nNow, should an implementation want to support some form of handling the exception without the ERROR STOP with its inadvertent side effects, they might provide some wiring as follows:\n   subroutine sub_e( x, *, e )\n      real, intent(inout) :: x\n      class(except_t), intent(out), optional :: e\n      ! An arbitrary range that causes an exception\n      if ( (x > 0.4).and.(x < 0.6) ) then\n         e%procname = \"sub\"\n         e%line = 17\n         e%estat = 1\n         e%emsg = \"Invalid value of x\"\n         return 1\n      end if\n      x = x + 1.0\n      return\n   end subroutine\n\nwhere an ALTERNATE RETURN is combined with an additional argument of OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTE which is of an arbitrary EXCEPTION class (say except_t) that can hold 'data' pertaining to the exception like so:\nmodule except_m\n   implicit none\n   type :: except_t\n      integer :: line = 0\n      integer :: estat = 0\n      character(len=:), allocatable :: procname\n      character(len=:), allocatable :: emsg\n   end type\nend module\n\nImplementation might also overload the library method so it can be invoked with or without such 'handling':\n   generic :: sub => sub_e, sub_x\n\nThen on the caller side the implementation might 'parse' out their own TRY-CATCH syntax with Fortran semantics described using the standard facility of BLOCK construct as follows:\ntry_catch: block\n   use except_m, only : except_t\n   type(except_t) :: e\n   call sub(x, *1, e)  !<-- note here\n   exit try_catch\n   !

Non-local jumps. As fas as I know, non-local jumps are not supported by the standard.\nWhen handling exceptions, one wants to abruptly stops the program at a given point and manage the program behaviour in a different point. Without using non-local jumps one can only \"handle exceptions vertically\" and per block-of-code instead of per-instruction.\nMy proposal here is to support non-local jumps.\nHope to be helpful!"

So I think the counterpoint is to not standardize a preprocessor, but rather improve language features so that the preprocessor is not needed.\nBesides templates, one common use case for a preprocessor that I have seen in many codes is a custom ASSERT macro, which is empty in Release mode, and in Debug mode it checks the condition and prints out the filename and line number.

This is the one major part of Fortran that every compiler provides that is not covered by the standard language document; but perhaps improving portability of Fortran programs across vendors, writing interoperable header files usable by Fortran and C++, or providing safe guarantees of portability into the future are no longer primary objectives.\nAs part of defining f18's preprocessing behavior, I performed a survey of various Fortran compilers and wrote a collection of tests to check how their preprocessors interacted with difficult Fortran features like line continuation, fixed form, &c.  The current state of the art is far more fragmented than I expected to find (see my link above for details and a compiler comparison table), and none of the existing compilers seemed to stand out as a model to be followed.\nEDIT: The standard does have a concept of source files in the context of INCLUDE lines, of course; my first sentence was too broad."

Perhaps it does not need to go into the standard itself, but then let there be a document that we all agree upon, we do not need to call it the \"standard\" (perhaps we can call it \"vendor recommendation\"), but it will achieve what we want: improving portability across vendors."

You add this one file to your project, and you can build your project with all Fortran compilers, as your pre-processor on board makes sure that the compiler only sees standard conforming source files. You will have to have the interpreter of course around whenever the project is built, but by choosing something wide-spread as Python, it would be the case on almost all systems automatically.\nDisclaimer: I may be biased as I myself also wrote such a one file pre-processor (Fypp) which apparently has found its way into several Fortran projects."

Although those lines are the same except for property names (like foo), I cannot write them conveniently at once (with standard Fortran/cpp/fpp).

When you have a compiler such as gfortran that isn't even full F2003, yet has features from F2008 and F2018, what would you have it define?\nAs I wrote above. J3 did standardize a preprocessor and it was roundly ignored by the community. I have also observed that programmers are often misinformed about the revision of the standard they are using.\nI would like to see preprocessors die and would not want to put anything in the standard that encourages their use. They're useful today because the language lacks features such as robust generics/templates, but work in that area is progressing with some 202X features helping. Past use to deal with C interoperability is no longer necessary. If you feel you need to write different code for different compilers, it would better to use the greatest common subset and enhance that as the compilers you use catch up. The alternative feels like a testing and maintenance nightmare to me.\nA common strategy I have seen is to not use a feature that isn't supported in at least three compilers. I observe that this is likely to be less of a problem over the coming years as I see compilers catching up to the standard much more quickly than in the past 5-10 years.\n\nI'm not proposing anything for the standard here.  I understand that you don't want to standardize preprocessing, and that you get to decide whether preprocessing is standardized or not.  Fine.\nBut preprocessing is still used in real codes by real users, it's part of every Fortran implementation, and I would like to provide the best implementation of preprocessing for them that I can in f18 in the absence of guidance from a standard."

As easy to expect, the second line will not be printed as the block exits before a sheep falls off the roof. Another advantage of using blocks is that as the complexity grows it gives us the encapsulated code segment that is ready separate into a subroutine. The blocks statement can almost be treated like in-place subroutine which is called exactly once, and many of the behaviors (such as access and overriding global variables) are the same. However, this symmetry is not complete, as all exit statements have to been replaced with return:\nsubroutine count_sheep\n  integer n\n  read (*, *) n\n  print '(i0, \" sheep on the roof\")', n\n  exit count_sheep ! solution: replace this with return\n  n = n - 1\n  print '(\"one sheep fell and \", i0, \" sheep remained\")', n\nend subroutine count_sheep\n\ncall count_sheep()\n\nend\nThe return statement is a bit outdated, as its only purpose in modern Fortran is to exit the subroutine (the alternate returns are not used). In C, return is responsible for the return value of the procedure. However, in Fortran functions this works differently. So we are left with only one situation where return is used, while in other contexts (loops, blocks) exit is used.\nAlthough it seems like a minor detail and unnecesary burden, I think this solution would be very in the Fortran spirit, as it brings more explicit and cleaner programming.\nDominik",

If the loop is safe to parallelize in a straightforward manner -- any object that is modified is neither referenced nor modified in any other iteration -- and any potential cases that might be ambiguous due to the crazy default localization rule are confined to objects with simple names, then an explicit SHARED locality specifier would resolve the problem and permit parallelization.  That probably covers my original example, depending on the contents of the indirect indexing arrays.\nFor cases involving objects that don't have simple names, it's not clear.  (Take my original example, but make T a  component.)  This is why I said that the DEFAULT(SHARED) that Malcolm told you to use would be an improvement, if it existed in the language.\nIf there were a locality specifier (or other syntax) that changed the treatment of variables with unspecified locality so that the compiler would automatically localize only variables that were simple names of scalars, that would solve the problem."

Is there some non-trivial class of problems for which users can reasonably expect a compiler to be able to optimize do concurrent, whether by vectorization, parallelization, or offloading?   For example, I think you've mentioned in separate correspondence with me that the problem that arises in the code you provided in comment 560517989 above would not occur in code that makes no use of indirect addressing or pointers.  I think there are many structured-grid scientific computing calculations that can be done without such features so it's not a severe restriction.

Could a programmer reasonably expect that a compiler could effectively optimize  a do concurrent loop with no indirect addressing, no pointers, and with a default(none) clause?

I don't think that the implementations or standard for Fortran can help your parallelize sparse matrix codes without recourse to directive-based solutions.  For codes without pointers or indirection, one can try DO CONCURRENT and see if it works, but be ready to resort to directives on good old DO where it doesn't.  It's not performance portable."

Three J3 members have explained in detail the situation and how the F18 locality specs essentially solve the problem, if programmers use them. It was also explained that the issues you raised had previously been discussed in detail. I'm failing to understand the continued antipathy here.\n@rouson , I have said often that parallelism is not one of my strengths, so I rely on the advice and opinions of others who live this stuff. My (perhaps flawed) understanding is that as of F18, DO CONCURRENT enables more parallelism than F08 did. I know it is following what OpenMP did, and I have to believe that the folks developing OpenMP know what they are doing. I also have faith in J3, with representatives from multiple HPC compiler vendors, that DO CONCURRENT does what compiler vendors want for parallelism.\nI have not yet seen any evidence that yet another parallel construct adds any value. The Fortran standard does not attempt to solve 100% of any possible programmer need. There is a balance between complexity and usability. Consider RANDOM_NUMBER, for an example of something I understand better. Does the spec for RANDOM_NUMBER satisfy every numerical analysis or statistical developer? Of course not, as some might want different distributions, etc., but it works well for a lot of cases. For those where it doesn't, there are libraries.\nRegarding your asking Intel to make standard-conforming behavior the default - you're unlikely to get that from a long-history commercial compiler, as the howls from paying customers will be loud. As you note, Intel has a single flag that does what you want, and even offers a way to set this system-wide (or user wide). Intel has changed defaults in places where it could be done transparently, such as automatic reallocation on assignment.\nThere's a related discussion going on in comp.lang.fortran where a couple of users are bashing the (few remaining) gfortran developers for having the temerity to have the compiler check by default for violation of standard rules that have been in place since F66. At least these are compile-time messages for violations of the standard - think of what the response would be if programs that were standard-conforming before (because the standard didn't specify something) behaved differently at run-time without any obvious cause.\nThe Fortran standard has always been in the position of asking the programmer to follow certain rules, and if they do, then they are rewarded with expected behavior. The rules for DO CONCURRENT about definition changes across iterations are there to allow compilers to parallelize, and there exist compilers that can and do parallelize these when the rules are followed. I don't pretend to claim that every possible loop body can be parallelized, but my understanding is that the current syntax and rules are good enough for most usages. If one wants even more control, then look at OpenMP. I can't find much enthusiasm for examples of constructs that have always been difficult to parallelize, even with the most capable of methods."

But DEFAULT(SHARED) doesn't exist in the language, and would necessitate wordy and error-prone LOCAL() specifiers for non-shared variables (or BLOCK).  A DO CONCURRENT plus DEFAULT(SHARED) with further automatic localization for the obvious scalar variable names that are unconditionally defined in each iteration would solve the problem.  DEFAULT(SHARED_EXCEPT_NO_BRAINER_SCALARS) seems like too much typing, though.\nThe discussion on comp.lang.fortran about extant code that associates scalar actual arguments with dummy arrays across implicit interfaces exposes the distinction between de facto and de jure standards.   IMO, something that's worked for decades with mulitple compilers is not something that should be messed with absent very good reasons.

Add syntax (e.g., `DO PARALLEL` or `DO CONCURRENT() DEFAULT(PARALLEL)`)\n   by which we can inform the compiler that it should localize only\n   the obvious cases of simple local scalars.\n   Such syntax seems unlikely to ever be standardized, so its usage\n   would be nonportable.\n\nThis would be my first choice, especially given the historical precedents\nfor features being supported first as extensions before becoming part of\nthe standard.  Coarray features might be the most appropriate precedent\nbecause they relate to parallelism.  Didn't Cray support coarrays for years\nbefore they became standard?  I imagine it was a much heavier lift to get\nall the coarray features into the standard than either of the above\nchoices. In the interim, a preprocessor could easily switch either of the\nabove to standard syntax.\n\n2. Add a command-line option &/or a source directive to stipulate\n   the stronger guarantees.  Obvious non-parallelizable usage in the\nconstruct\n   would elicit a stern warning.  The `DO CONCURRENT` loops in the source\n   would continue to be portable to other compilers.\n\nThe command-line option would be my third choice, but it's really not such\na bad choice.  The code would remain standard and portable and anyone\nserious about optimizing code is likely to spend time investigating the\ncommand-line options for each compiler they use.  I'd rather not clutter\nthe code with compiler-specific directives, especially if other compilers\ngo down a similar path but choose different syntax.  If the directive\napproach is taken, I hope the directive is a potential candidate for\ninclusion into the OpenMP standard, but that seems a lot less likely than\ngetting option 1 into the Fortran standard.\n\n3. Assume that these stronger conditions hold by default, and add a\ncommand-line\n   option &/or a source directive to \"opt out\" back to the standard\n   behavior in the event that the program contains one of those\n   non-parallelizable `DO CONCURRENT` loops that should never have\n   been possible to write in a conforming program in the first place.\n   Programmers writing parallel `DO CONCURRENT` loops would get what\n   they wanted without ever knowing that there's a problem with the\n   standard.\n   But this could lead to non-standard behavior for codes that depend,\n   accidentally or not, on non-parallelizable implicit localization.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, I can't count the number of hours of my life\nthat I've lost looking for a bug in my code only to find eventually that\nthere was no bug.  I had just forgotten to pass a flag to get the compiler\nto comply with the standard.  I beg you to make standard behavior the\ndefault behavior.\n\n4. Accept the standard as it exists, do the best job of automatic\n   parallelization that can be done, and refer dissatisfied users to J3.\n   This would be avoiding the problem.\n\nThis would be my second choice.  I think of this as being embedded in the\nfirst option.  Create a new syntax that does what you want and accept the\nstandard as is when users choose the standard syntax.\n\nI hope this is helpfu.\n\nDamian\n\u2026\nOn Thu, Aug 27, 2020 at 10:39 AM Peter Klausler ***@***.***> wrote:\n https://reviews.llvm.org/D86556\n\n We\u2019re still trying to figure out what we\u2019re going to do with DO CONCURRENT\n in f18 (flang).

Short of that, I would also be satisfied if\nOpenMP can be used to parallelize or vectorize or offload DO CONCURRENT in\nthe absence of the compiler doing it automatically.

On a related note, I just completed an exercise in co-developing a\nmini-app in which we attempted to take functional programming to a logical\nextreme: with the exception of I/O procedures, every procedure in the\nmini-app is a PURE function with no local variables -- just associations\nwherein a name is associated with a function result or expression and is\ntherefore immutable state.  I was surprised at just how far this got us and\nwith the ultimate clarity of the code.  At just of shy of 1,500 lines, it\nwas the longest code I've ever written that worked almost flawlessly on\nfirst testing.  This experience emboldens me to write PURE functions more\nand more and one benefit will be that all of my functions can be invoked\ninside DO CONCURRENT.  I suspect that code written in this style will be\nmuch easier for the programmer to parallelize even in the absence of\nautomatic compiler parallelization.  One of the first places I encountered\nthe notion that functional programming aids parallelization was in a 1991\nLawrence Livermore technical report entitled \"Retire Fortran? A debate\nrekindled.\"  It's fascinating to me just how much of what that paper was\ncalling for in a new language (SISAL) instead resembles what Fortran\neventually became.\n\nEdit by @certik: here is the report: https://doi.org/10.1145/135226.135231"

Rather they can follow a somewhat open approach which allows work to proceed on many good ideas based of course on some objective, initial screening.  Then, in this day and age of modern collaborative platforms such as GitHub and amazing multitasking abilities of interested and multi-talented folks, considerable progress can occur online in parallel and near-ready features for official standard publication can be developed. so much so that committee can increasingly be in a critical review mode, to cross-check and resend for correction or refine work, thereby saving themselves so much time.  What is needed mostly are some guidelines or criteria - clearer the better - on what to do or not do in terms of additions/changes to the Fortran standard.\nDelegate to develop faster is what the committee can best do for Fortran.\nMany, many ideas like the one with ALLOCATE statement in this thread can then be absorbed into the next revision.\nIt is then too bad something like this will have to wait for Fortran 202Y."

Iteration over the different problems moved into that procedure. Procedures it needed, that need arrays depending upon the problem size, became internal procedures. The module became a monster.\nAs coroutines, instead of being internal, each could be in its own module, and invoked with the maximum size, immediately suspending, then resumed with each different size, without re-creating the activation record.\nAnd, of course, iterators are useful independently of concurrency.

In that case, we might consider something like #58.\nThe goal should be to design the language features well, so that we do not end up with lots of orthogonal features that do not play well together.

If I want to write compilers, C++ is a better language (and so I chose C++ for LFortran). If I want to write web servers, then Python, Go, or other languages are much better also. But if I want to write numerical code, Fortran is a much better language than C++ (easier to write, read and for compilers to optimize), and I would like it to stay that way.\nWhen you say \"general-purpose\", what domains do you want Fortran to be used in?

And as part of this, what features would you like to see added?\n\nI think the Wikipedia page  on Fortran got it correct with its description, \"Fortran is a general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.\"  And it summarizes Fortran as \"multi-paradigm: structured, imperative (procedural, object-oriented), generic.\"  Fortran is now also a  parallel programming language - cheers!\nNumeric computations and scientific computing are now highly multidisciplinary and they involve a lot of cross-fertilization and collaboration, as you know.  And increasingly, there is the acceptance of \"computational science\" as a veritable third branch of scientific advancement that draws from and also feeds into progress in the traditional ones of theory and experiments.  Given all this, Fortran needs to continually evolve with advances with science and computing and it needs to offer features that cover almost all the paradigms, as listed above.\nProcessing of massive amounts of data in whatever format, machine or human-readable, toward all manner of activities - whether it be climate modeling, DNA research, machine learning, AI/automation, visualization, etc.  - is also just as important to scientific and numeric computing as floating-point computation of matrices.  It's often counter-productive, I think, to stress one area, say array arithmetic of reals, too much above some other e.g., bit stream processing,\nMy vision is for Fortran to rise back as the lingua franca in scientific and technical computing.  I think this requires Fortran to be an evolving and advancing language that keeps pace in terms of being \"feature complete\" toward the programming needs of scientists and technologists.\nThe way I see things is that Fortran currently has GAPS in a few areas of critical interest to computational scientists and technologists including in research, academia, and especially industry.  Thus it is NOT \"feature complete\".  The results of the survey by WG5 cover most of these gaps e.g., generics, exception handling, bit data processing, unsigned integers, etc.  And I would add a few more in object-oriented aspects as well as good coding practices.  Most of these are essentially \"solved problems\" in terms of computer engineering; robust and functional implementations are available in too many languages and there is little to no open-ended computer science research/investigation element in almost any of the current gaps e.g., Ada added support for generics during the early 1990s.\nSo my immediate mission will be to try to help \"knock off\"  as many items on the gaps list as quickly as possible, so Fortran can get back to being competitive with other languages and compute platforms.\nModern Fortran is, unfortunately, like the curate's egg, good only in parts and that too only with a modern i.e., \"p.c.\" interpretation of that phrase.   When one tries to \"use it in anger\" toward any big, new effort or attempt a significant refactoring of an existing FORTRAN legacy code-base one ends up uttering stuff like in this cartoon:  WG5 is either unaware or in denial about this basic fact.  That has gotta change, otherwise Fortran will soon lose its raison d'etre."

Basically, problem formulation is itself very hard.  But once it is done for any of the features including generics, a solution can be developed given the current state of compiler \"technology\".  Now the direction Fortran was going previously with generics was driven by an attempt to limit the language to certain use cases and that was pushed by an influential few.  A narrow mind can greatly hijack the conceptualization phase and bias the problem formulation."

I guess this is partly because Fortran is \"weak\" for the treatment of non-regular/non-rectangular data structures. (Here, \"weak\" = \"doable but very tedious or inconvenient\").\nFrom FORTRAN II to Modern Fortran (in Medium)\nhttps://medium.com/science-uncovered/modern-fortran-e6c3d2290d03\nThe last paragraph of the above page says:\n\nSo we see that Fortran\u2019s particular advantages as a high-end numerical language, especially where arrays are the main form of data object and/or where complex arithmetic is involved, are still to the fore. It is able to attain the highest achievable optimization, mainly because multi-dimensional arrays are \u2018natural\u2019 objects and because its pointers are highly constrained.\n\nHowever, this also implies that Fortran is not strong for non-array data structures. Though multi-dimensional arrays are 'natural' objects in some applications, they are not the main data structures in other applications. To me, the trend of less adoption of Fortran is partly because of the latter.\nThough I am not familiar with FEM, I remember having read some posts or articles that mentions the switch from Fortran to C++ is partly for this reason, i.e., to facilitate the treatment of complicated non-regular data structures.)\nAlso, though I am not familiar with HPC either, there seems to be an increasing trend for more importance of non-regular or sparse data.\nhttps://graph500.org/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPCG_benchmark\nAs for heterogenous data, Fortran does not even provide a builtin \"map\" or \"dictionary\" type. Each user needs to create them or search for external libraries (which is not only inconvenient, but also the performance may not be optimal)."

But now, OO is such a critical aspect of so many large and new code-bases coming up in the scientific and technical computing domains even (particularly in industry) and it's blended so much together with other paradigms including parallel programming that to overlook areas of improvement toward OO in Fortran is a major disservice.\nBack to the smallish aspect: I think it is entirely reasonable for a group of practitioners to want to control \"namespaces\" and particularly their \"pollution\" (which are at the root of several issues like #1, #87, etc.) in one way, say via\nuse, namespace :: foo_m\n..\ncall foo_m::bar(..  ! note :: is only an illustrative token\n..\nand another group to do so by\nuse foo_m, only : bar ..\n..\ncall bar(..\n..\nand for Fortran to support both the options which legitimately fall in the category of good coding practices.\nThe usual arguments against this are language bloat and time-resource constraints for standard development.  I personally do not think the first is applicable once a matter at hand has the passed the filter of good coding practice.  The latter is something that can be managed better and better by striving continuously for improved collaboration and greater workflow efficiency with online platforms like this.\nFortran seriously needs to evolve faster and further to have any hope of being relevant in the future."

However, for large multiphysics codes, a lot of time is spent doing all the maintenance around the numerical core (reading input files, managing the many multiphysics pieces, turning features on and off, ....) and for that C++ does provide more building blocks that one can use, while in Fortran the hands are tied. And so even though C++ is worse for the numerical part, one you get a very large code, the argument for C++ is very compelling. (It becomes subjective, I personally prefer using Fortran for very large codes also, but people who know both and prefer C++ have a very solid reason for that, that cannot be dismissed as \"they don't know what they are talking about\").\nAnd so that is the main motivation for adding dictionaries, lists into the language, better string support (#24), some generic programming, improvements in OO, etc., to help maintain large codes and give maintainers of those codes tools to choose from so that their hand is not so tied behind their back. For the performance critical parts of the codes, one should still use raw arrays and loops, just like today.\nFortran strength can also be in parallel programming (coarrays being in the language) and in principle on GPU also. But currently C++ has at least a way to run on GPUs (Kokkos, RAJA), while Fortran does not (yes, there is CUDA Fortran which some of our teams use, but it does not work in every compiler...) --- and that is the primary motivation why there is a strong push away from Fortran to C++."

The Hendrickson/Spackman SHAPE95 suite was licensed by multiple vendors, and it was good, but work stopped on it. While I was at Intel I became aware of an Italian user, whose name escapes me, who appeared to be creating a useful test suite covering all the syntax, but maybe not the full semantics. I have no idea what happened to that as we stopped hearing from him (bug reports) after a while.\nThis is a far bigger task than you might imagine, and requires serious, ongoing resources. It is not something the Fortran committee, all volunteers taking time from their day jobs, can develop or even specify/manage. As a former vendor, I can tell you that vendors would be happy to pay for a good test suite with ongoing maintenance and support. But who is going to create it? These vendors (and I'll include freeware developers in this) all have their own test suites, largely comprised of collected applications, unit and regression tests; but they are far from comprehensive, no matter how good intentioned.\nWriting a good test is much harder than you might think. Compiler developers are the wrong people to write tests, as they will test what they think the feature is supposed to do. For a while, Intel had a dedicated team, separate from the compiler group, writing tests based on the documentation; it worked very well and uncovered many bugs, but the team, funded by a different organization, was disbanded and we lost that resource.\nThe big problem as I see it is that the market for such a test suite is small compared to the cost of creating and maintaining it. The only way I could see this happening is if some government funded the effort, as they did in the F77 days, and I don't see that happening today, especially for Fortran.\nSo, yes, it would be fantastic if a good, modern Fortran test suite existed and was maintained. Who is going to do it?"

This seems to be one of the more popular ideas.\nOnce we have established that we want to get this done, we can shift the discussion into how to get it done. I can see several approaches, and there might be more ways to get it done:\n\n\nVendors can collaborate on a common opensource project. But as you said, in some sense they are the \"wrong people\" to write such tests.\n\n\nVendors can all pool to fund a separate entity to write and maintain such a testsuite. As you said, vendors might be willing to pay for such a thing. There are several models how this can be done. I am at a NumFOCUS summit conference right now and there are many efforts to allow precisely such funding. One is OpenTeams, where the idea is that (opensource) projects can propose an idea, and OpenTeams facilitates the discussion with companies to sell the idea to them and companies can pool together to fund this. Writing modern Fortran testsuite might be a good fit. There are other ways to get it funded also.\n\n\nSo it might be possible to secure and facilitate the funding. The next question is who will do that. Again, there are several approaches here:\n\n\nI talked with @nncarlson a few days ago, and we are actually both interested in working on such a testsuite. But as you said, this is a much bigger task than two people can do. But we can help. This is just an example that it is possible to find interested parties to help.\n\n\nCompiler vendors can actually help a lot too, as long as this project is properly lead by somebody who understands the task at hand and can ensure the overall quality of the testsuite.\n\n\nSomebody would need to assemble a team and lead this effort and try to get it funded. This comment can serve as some ideas how to do so."

And there might be other community members willing to contribute similarly.\nTo show an example, here's a case I've been grappling with the last couple of weeks: I think the code is conforming per my read of current standard, however it fails with 2 processors I tried which then makes me wonder if the compilers have bugs in their implementations or whether I'm in the wrong.  If it is the former i.e., compiler bugs, then this might be a possible case for inclusion in the \"modern Fortran testsuite\":\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <assert.h>\n#include \"ISO_Fortran_binding.h\"\n\nvoid Csub(const CFI_cdesc_t *, size_t);\n\nvoid Csub(const CFI_cdesc_t * dv, size_t locd) {\n\n   CFI_index_t lb[1];\n   lb[0] = dv->dim[0].lower_bound;\n   size_t ld = (size_t)CFI_address(dv, lb);\n\n   printf(\"In C function: CFI_address of dv = %lx\\n\", ld);\n   assert( ld == locd );\n   return;\n\n}\n!

                    "text": "@FortranFan I will setup the infrastructure very soon and I will update this issue when I do so.\nHere is my plan so far:\nThe testsuite would be separate and independent of any compiler. It would contain metadata about what feature is being tested, which files, and any other useful info, and then it would also contain (probably Python) library showing how to load all the tests and process them.\nThere can be lots of backends, either as part of the test suite, or separate, for things like autogenerated CMake build system to test any compiler, or to generate a nice website with the coverage for each compiler, etc.\nThen compilers, such as LFortran, can have scripts that take this and process the files and create an LFortran specific testsuite from it, for example I'd like to generate parts of this test file.\nOther compilers could do something similar. For example for Flang the files in https://github.com/flang-compiler/f18/tree/fdb351ca2afb0d71028785da4687113343e11f54/test/semantics could be generated from such a testsuite. One downside is that the Flang testsuite has a compiler dependent checks for error messages, so it might not be possible to generate such tests from a compiler independent test suite.\nOne worry that I have is that if the testsuite files change (for whatever reason), then when Flang or LFortran specific testsuite gets regenerated, it will break (the test won't pass anymore). Or to formulate it in another way --- to what extent can a compiler testsuite be \"outsourced\" to a compiler independent testsuite? Can it even work? I don't have the answer.\nIf it cannot be done, then the answer is that each compiler still has to maintain its own testsuite, and the compiler independent \"standard\" testsuite is then used to automatically check what features are being implemented by each compiler, and also each compiler can at least take the standard testsuite as a starting point and then adapt it to its needs.\n@klausler what are your thoughts on this?"

Test cases that can be run manually through a compiler without knowledge of infrastructure are the most useful.\nIn practical terms, I suggest making a distinction between three kinds of tests:\n\nTests meant to compile and execute successfully if a particular requirement/constraint/feature is correctly and completely implemented.\nTests meant to compile successfully but abort during execution as they violate some constraint or \"shall\" clause; execution to completion means that the implementation has failed the test.\nTests meant to not compile successfully, with errors being indicated at/near some locations in their source code.\n\nTests in the first group should be as self-contained as possible and execute in such a way that it's easy to determine from the shell or other tools that they terminated happily; perhaps via STOP 'PASS'.\nTests in the second group should terminate with an expected error code at runtime; if they run to completion, they should indicate to the shell or other tools that they failed to detect a required error, perhaps via STOP 'FAIL'.\nTests in the third group should have their source code marked with comments describing expected error messages.  Testing this group against a particular compiler may be best done by capturing error messages from that compiler, validating them manually, and saving them as \"known good\" compiler output, deviation from which may indicate errors later.  If a compiler fails to catch an error and the program somehow survives to execution, it should crash with a message, perhaps via ERROR STOP 'FAIL'.  It would be best if tests in this third group were as small as possible, eliciting a single error message, so that useful results could be obtained just by throwing these cases at a compiler and verifying that it refuses to compile each of them."

I would love to have access to an authoritative suite of tests for the current revision of the standard, so that I wouldn't have to wade my way through all the ambiguity and imprecision in the text itself in an attempt to write tests for it.  An authoritative test suite would reduce the size of f18's future test directories as the standard evolves; and if the committee had to develop or subcontract the development of such tests, perhaps ambiguity would be exposed earlier and fixed sooner.  As is, we have access to many open- and closed-source test suites as well as applications, and depend heavily on all of them.\nOh, one last point that's really more important than it might seem:  the Fortran standard updates section, requirement, and constraint numbers in incompatible ways with each revision.  It's important for f18 compiler and test source code to refer frequently to the standard document.  When Fortran 202x arrives, all of those textual citations are going to have to be updated if the standard continues to gratuitously renumber them.

Because AdHoc stores compiler bug reproducers, its build scripts are designed to continue building the remainder of the repository after a compile-time error occurs.   This makes it feasible to generate a standards-conformance table based on a test suite that includes code with features not supported by the involved compilers.  The build scripts could automatically generated table in GitHub Markdown structured something like the following:\n\n\n\n\nCompiler A\nCompiler B\n\n\n\n\nFeature A\nYes\nNo\n\n\nFeature B\nPartial\nYes\n\n\n\nEach entry would correspond to a unique subdirectory.  Contributors would submit pull requests with tests that enable the build/test scripts to set the value of each entry according to the following rules:\n\n\"No\" for an empty subdirectory or one in which all tests fail,\n\"Yes\" if all tests in the subdirectory pass, or\n\"Partial\" otherwise.\n\nFor example, the following directory tree would yield the above table if the tests foo.f90, bar.f90, and foobartoo.f90 pass but foobar.f90 fails:\n$ tree tests\ntests/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 compiler-a\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 feature-a\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 foo.f90\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 feature-b\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u251c\u2500\u2500 bar.f90\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0     \u2514\u2500\u2500 foobar.f90\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 compiler-b\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 feature-a\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 feature-b\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 foobartoo.f90\n\nFor free compilers, the tests could be run at no cost using GitHub continuous integration features.  For non-free compilers, another mechanism for running the tests might be required.  The degree of comprehensiveness of the test suite would be determined by the community."

Regarding your second question, there are two package managers specifically for C++: Conan and Vcpkg. A language neutral package managers that many recommend for C++ (and Fortran!) are Spack and Conda (already linked in the issue description above).\n@gronki thanks for the feedback.\nFortran needs a standard way to create and distribute libraries. There is a lot to improve.\nWhat is not clear at this stage is what things, if anything, needs to be improved in the Fortran standard itself. But there might be some things to improve there, and for that reason I would like to keep discussing it here.\nI discussed this issue with many people, and there are generally two camps: a language specific package manager (like Julia, Python, ...) and those who advocate for packaging all languages (such as C++, Fortran, Python, ...) in language neutral package managers such as Conda or Spack.\nI would much prefer if we can figure out ways to just use Conda, Spack or another solution, so that we do not need to maintain things ourselves. However, there might be some Fortran specific things that we might need to figure out.\nRegarding building from source (Spack) or distributing binaries (Conda), I think we need both. We need to build from source, as that is what is needed on HPC to build an optimized static build for a specific architecture, but also be able to distribute binaries (Conda) is very helpful for users that just want to get something working quickly and do not want to wait hours to build all the dependencies."

The ideal situation is that a package registry (or manager) provides a search mechanism for candidate packages, show the degree of maintenance level explicitly (e.g. by showing validation/test results for major compilers/versions), show dependence (e.g. 3rd-party libraries/versions required), explicitly state license (to facilitate open-source use), and provide feedback mechanism such as popularity measures and issue reports..."

Yes, you and I talked about this, and I also talked at length with @SylvainCorlay and discussed at your Gitter about this exact question. We also discussed with the Julia developers a few times.\nFPM is still just a prototype, I started it in Rust, but I really wanted @everythingfunctional to join our effort and he already had a similar version implemented in Haskell, so I convinced @milancurcic to switch to Haskell for the prototype. For the production version, I still think it should be Rust or C++, to make it easier for people to contribute. But let's discuss that later, for the prototype it doesn't matter from the user perspective, as long as it produces a statically linked binary, which Haskell does.\nAbout 80% of the arguments are the same for Rust as for Fortran. So let's discuss Rust, because it already has a mature ecosystem. Why couldn't Rust just use Conda? There are multiple reasons:\n\nMust be fast and a simple binary / easy to distribute. Conda fails, but Mamba might fix this.\nMust be a source distribution, in other words, build everything from source, not a binary distribution. Conda traditionally has been a binary distribution, and so a non-starter. If there was a way to make it a hybrid, as you mention, then let's discuss this more, maybe there is a way.\nThe key really is to build from source and have a robust build system from source.\nCargo understands the Rust default layout: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html, which makes it trivial to make a new package: just put files in the correct place on the filesystem, write a generic Cargo.toml and things will just work -- no need to write any manual build system (in CMake let's say), nor telling Cargo where files are.\n\nIn addition to these, Fortran has a few specific things:\n\nIt must work with any Fortran compiler (see here https://fortran-lang.org/compilers/ for a full list: several open source ones and about 12 commercial ones). One cannot mix and match compilers, one must recompile everything from scratch\nYou must be able to compile everything for your given computer with all optimizations on, to get the best performance (Fortran applications must be fast) --- one cannot just compile on an older hardware ahead of time in order to ensure that things run everywhere (as Conda does it), because you will miss performance.\n\nFPM will also have Fortran specific knowledge, such as figuring out the dependencies between modules, and enforcing proper module naming convention based on where things are in the filesystem, and enforcing a Fortran specific layout. I don't know how that could be done with Mamba, as this is really Fortran specific.\nAlso, we want FPM to eventually become the default front end to Fortran: compiler independent invocation (i.e. you can use a compiler of your choice, and FPM will figure out the different ways Fortran compilers are being called), create a new project easily, all kinds of checks, automatic formatting, etc. (just like Cargo does this to rust --- you don't call rustc by hand, you just call cargo).\nIn general, we are aiming for a smooth and nice user experience, just like Cargo delivers it for Rust.\nLet's discuss more if you are interested."

                    "text": "Thanks for the lengthy reply! I know you did your homework thoroughly :)\nRegarding source distribution: I don't see anything that would prevent this in Mamba -- conda packages are (almost) just tarballs of whatever was installed into the prefix that wasn't there before. So if your build script just copies the source over to some magic directory, then I think that's totally fine.\nI understand that it's nice to have the build system and the package manager integrated tightly. In my opinion those are two slightly different roles.\nWe definitely want to do a conda-compatible mamba-build as well which should be much faster.\nWith conda-build or mamba-build nothing prevents you today from adding a package fortran-build-scripts that contains some shell scripts, depends on cmake etc. so that building Fortran packages becomes a one-liner in the meta.yaml. Here is a sample meta.yaml (for others, that's how one expresses dependencies and build steps in conda):\npackage:\n  name: my_super_fortran_pkgs\n  version: 0.12.2\n\nsource:\n  path: https://.../download.tar.gz\n\nbuild:\n   script: fcomp -DSOME_ARG -MHELLO_WORLD\n\nrequirements:\n  build:\n    - my_fortran_buildscripts\n    - {{ FORTRAN_IMPL }}\n  host:\n    - some_dependency 0.14.*\n\nIn this case, fcomp would be a shell script (or some other executable) that's part of the my_fortran_buildscripts package.\nI have a conda-forge enhancement proposal that I want to push next week that would add these kind of build scripts to conda-forge at least for CMake and autogen.\nOne other thing I want to mention: I think the API surface of mamba is somewhat cleaner. For example, here is an example on how one can use the mamba API from Python to get a solution for a set of package specs:\nhttps://gist.github.com/wolfv/cd12bd4a448c77ff02368e97ffdf495a\nSo if you wanted to you could also build on top of Mamba (and conda-packages) and implement the build system as a part on top of mamba (the same APIs shown in Python are obviously available from C++ as well). These API's will cover everything from prefix activation to repodata downloading and then to package dependency solving and installation.\nI would be incredibly excited if you decided to do this with us, and obviously I would be happy to discuss this further."

As I mentioned, it is heavily inspired by Cargo, so if you want to play with a good well designed production tool, play with Cargo a little bit.\nWe are completely open about the underlying technology, but we really care about the end user experience, which we want to be exactly (or very close to) what is in the above PACKAGING.md document. The key part is that users just write a simple fpm.toml file:\nname = \"hello\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nlicense = \"MIT\"\nauthor = \"Jane Programmer\"\nmaintainer = \"jane@example.com\"\ncopyright = \"2020 Jane Programmer\"\nand fpm figures out how to build the project from the file layout (the same idea as Cargo). It knows how to build the application / executable (if present), library (if present) and tests / benchmarks (in the future).\nSo for example, we do want fpm to be able to generate a Conda package, in fact we already have an issue for it: fortran-lang/fpm#70\nIn there the easiest would be to simply call fpm from meta.yaml. That's similar to what you mentioned in your last comment.\nOnce we have dependency management (we'll start working on that very soon) there might be a way to link with mamba to help out there too."

            "text": "Extracted from #49. Author: Van Snyder\nIntroduction\nThe proposal for which authorization to proceed as an ISO Technical Specification was requested\nin June 2016 was N2113.\nIncorrect use of physical units is a common error in scientific or engineering software. Other\ncommon errors are mismatching the types of actual and dummy arguments, and subscript\nbound violations. Explicit interfaces largely solve the latter problems, but do nothing directly\nfor the former. (One can use derived types to provide a physical units system, at the expense\nof redefining intrinsic functions, operations, and assignment, for all combinations of units \u2013 a\ntremendous job for mechanics, saying nothing about thermodynamics, electronics, ... \u2013 and then\nyou hope for inlining. If done using type parameters or integer components, it can distinguish\nlength from time, but not kilograms from pounds.) A particularly expensive and embarrassing\nexample was the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter. The loss resulted because the NASA contract\nrequired small forces, e.g. from attitude-control maneuvers, to be reported in Newton-Seconds,\nbut Lockheed nonetheless reported them in Pound-Seconds. (This was quite inscrutable, as\nLockheed had had NASA contracts for over thirty years, and they always specified SI units.)\nProposal\nDefine a new UNIT or MEASURE attribute or type parameter (call it what you will) that\ncan be specified for any numeric variable or named constant. Literal constants are unitless.\nDefine multiplication and division operations on units. Exponentiation by an integer constant\ncould be defined to be equivalent to multiplication or division. Square root, or maybe even\nexponentiation of a unit by a rational number, would be useful. In the context of a unit\ndefinition, the integer literal constant 1 is considered to be the unitless unit.\nEach unit declaration creates one or more generic units conversion functions having the same\nname as the unit, that takes an argument with any related unit, and converts it to have units\nspecified by the name of the function. It also creates a function that casts unitless values to\nhave the specified unit. There is an intrinsic UNITLESS conversion function.\nQuantities can be added, subtracted, assigned, compared by relational operators, or argument\nassociated only if they have equivalent units. Atomic units, i.e. units that are not defined in\nterms of other units, are equivalent by name. Other units are equivalent by structure.\nWhen quantities are added or subtracted, the units of the result are the same as the units of\nthe operands. When quantities are multiplied or divided, the units of the result are the units\nthat result from applying the operation to the operands\u2019 units. Multiplication or division by a\nunitless operand produces a result having the same units as the other operand.\nUnits participate in generic resolution.\nProcedure arguments and function results can have abstract units. This allows enforcing a\nparticular relationship between the units, without requiring particular units. For example, the\nSQRT intrinsic function result has abstract units A, and its argument has abstract units A*A.\nAbstract units do not participate in generic resolution.\nDefine an intrinsic RADIAN unit, and a parallel set of generic intrinsic trigonometric functions\nthat take RADIAN arguments and produce unitless results. All of the remaining intrinsic\nprocedures have arguments with abstract units and results that are unitless (e.g. SELECTED -\nINT KIND) or have the same units as their argument (e.g. TINY). Because function results do\nnot participate in generic resolution, it is not possible to have a parallel set of generic intrinsic\ninverse trigonometric functions that return RADIAN results. It may be useful to provide an\nintrinsic module that has some public units and procedures, e.g. units TICK and SECOND and\na SYSTEM CLOCK module procedure that has arguments with units TICK, TICK/SECOND\nand SECOND.\nVariables are declared to have units by specifying UNIT(unit-name) as an attribute in their\ndeclarations, or alternatively by separate UNIT declaration statements.\nExamples:\nUNIT :: INCH, SECOND\nUNIT :: CM, INCH = 2.54 * CM\nUNIT :: CM_PER_INCH = CM / INCH\nREAL, PARAMETER, UNIT(CM_PER_INCH) :: CONVERT = 2.54\nUNIT :: SQINCH = INCH * INCH ! or INCH ** 2\nUNIT :: IPS = INCH / SECOND, FREQUENCY = 1 / SECOND ! or SECOND ** (-1)\nREAL, UNIT(SQINCH) :: A\nREAL, UNIT(FREQUENCY) :: F\nREAL, UNIT(INCH) :: L, L2\nREAL, UNIT(CM) :: C\nREAL, UNIT(SECOND) :: T\nREAL, UNIT(IPS) :: V\n\nV = A + L              ! INVALID -- SQINCH cannot be added to INCH,\n                       ! and neither one can be assigned to IPS\nV = IPS(A + SQINCH(L)) ! VALID -- I\u2019m screwing this up intentionally\nV = (A / L + L2) / T   ! VALID -- IPS is compatible with INCH / SECOND\nA = L * L2             !

Not the least of which being that conversion factors between units aren't always simple.

I looked at your implementation and it seems that creating values with units is as easy as 1.0d0.unit.METERS. But how do you actually use it, say an array of quantities? Can you add some documentation and post here? Does it require to define the array of derived types? Or just reals. I read through your tests, but it is still not clear. Looking at one such test: https://gitlab.com/everythingfunctional/quaff/blob/b515ae79fa0d68d44d25aefdc103234a760a5d54/tests/speed_test.f90#L31, it seems it requires to define density and density_?\nThe advantage of figuring out how to put this into the language itself is that one might define just regular arrays of real numbers (i.e., no derived types) and assign units to it with some syntax, and the compiler will check the units at compile time with no runtime overhead, and the natural already familiar syntax.\nI agree this would require a prior compiler implementation and usage in real codes to see if this is worth putting into the language."

And thus, if you wanted an array of densities, you would define one like type(Density_t) :: densities(5). It's possible add and subtract quantities of the same type, multiple and divide a quantity by a scalar, and dividing quantities of the same type returns a double precision. Quantities of the same type can also be compared with the normal operators. Additionally, each of the functions to divide or multiply different quantities is implemented specifically to return the correct resulting quantity. I.e. (1.0d0.unit.METERS) / (1.0d0.unit.SECONDS) == (1.0d0.unit.METERS_PER_SECOND) is valid and true. Additionally, all of the procedures are elemental, so you can do matrix math as well.\nThere is clearly some run time cost associated with this approach (about 3x cost to multiply 2 numbers as shown by my tests). But I find that to be acceptable in most instances given the added safety and convenience it brings. And if you're doing really performance sensitive stuff, the internal values are stored in SI units and are public so you can mitigate the slow down even further if need be.\nWith full compile time checking I'm not sure you could make this valid and extensible with new units.\nlengths(1:3) = [1.0d0.units.METERS, 1.0d0.units.FEET, 1.0d0.units.MICROMETERS]\n\nBut it works perfectly with my library. And it's possible to add new units and even quantities without actually needing to make any changes to the original library. If you want to use furlongs per fortnite for speed in your code, you just need to define a conversion factor from meters and a symbol somewhere in your code and it will work just fine."

This will help Fortran rise back as the lingua franca of scientific and technical/numerical programming.\nAlas this has been discussed elsewhere in the past and this idea faces great resistance.\nIdeally the core development of the Fortran language will, in a deep, philosophical sense, be independent and separate from the Fortran standard and the IEC ISO document for the Fortran standard would simply fall naturally out of the development process, as if a byproduct.  And most of the \"heavylifting\" to pull together the IEC ISO document would be mechanical that can be scripted/automated or otherwise be collated and refined by many sharp minds looking at it together i.e.,, the online collaborative model feasible using GitHub should work well for this.\nUnfortunately though, it appears as if the standard document is the cart that is placed before the horse for quite a while now and it is the product that dictates what Fortran can be or not i.e., an inverted development model is influencing matters.  The advancement of the language likely suffers as a consequence of this.\nAs things stand, the job of the standard editor is considered the most difficult and demanding.  And none but one is seen as being capable of it.  That should not be the case, it's way too risky for a language to be in such a precarious position, to be so badly dependent on one individual.  An online collaborative model that is designed to greatly ease the burden can make it such many, many people will aspire and be seen as capable of the editor's job.\nFortran really needs such security."

Until more people gain the trust of the community that they can have merge rights.\nAlso, this standard editing process should really be a byproduct of which proposals the committee approves.

I was one of the guys in the late 1970s that was responsible for its care and feeding to support Shuttle prior to first launch. What might interest the younger folks is this program (although the code base contained several thousand lines of code) ran on an UNIVAC 1108 system that had 64K (yes 64K) of memory to run programs in. The code had a preprocessor that figured out just what parts of the code you needed for your particular task based on your input and only compiled that. The UNIVAC compiler also supported OVERLAYS (which made debugging fun) so youcould go a little beyond the 64K into extended memory. Of course unlike today, the compiler was for the most part bullet proof. I don't remember ever encountering anything like an ICE in all the years I used the UNIVAC compilers (or VAX, CDC, early CRAY compilers from that era for that matter).  These days ICE appears to be the norm rather that the exception.\nAlso another historical note: The Space Shuttle on-board computers ran a language called Higher-Order Assembly Language/Shuttle (HAL/S) that was a derivative of XPL which in turn was a derivative of PL/I. It came out of MIT I believe because Draper Labs was heavily involved in the Guidance and Control software design."

However, since the current \"migration\" to Fortran 2003/2008/2018 and beyond is happening at glacial pace, I would propose the Monarch butterfly that migrates from Mexico to as far as southern Canada but takes five generations to do it. ie the butterflies that complete the migration are descendents of the ones that started from Mexico. All the other generations perish along the way. I'm afraid that like the Monarchs some of us will be long dead before Fortran completes its current \"migration\""

            "text": "I submitted this paper 19-229 at the recent J3 meeting in Las Vegas (October 14 - 18, 2019) but it was ignored on account of being inconsistent with the decision(s) at the joint WG5/J3 meeting in Tokyo earlier in August.  I was motivated to submit 19-229 based on the needs, use cases, and requirements (as explained below) I foresee users will want in Fortran towards their applications in scientific and technical computing and which were either not tabled during the discussion at Tokyo  or they were addressed rather inadequately.\nTake the IEEE spectrum rankings for most popular languages now and review the facilities toward enumerations in any of the top ones e.g., Swift as described here.  Should Fortranners want to start expressing their coding constructs in Fortran as clearly and succinctly as possible using any of these other options available to engineers and scientists and where type-safety is to be valued and \"magic\" values are to be avoided (I'll provide more information toward this later on in the comments section), they will seek a comprehensive facility similar to what is offered by, say, Swift language.  However what is on the anvil for Fortran 202X is a poor shadow of this, so the situation is of great concern to me.\nFrom the paper:\nIntroduction\nThis paper, while trying to build upon the benefits and features of enumeration types known generally and also stated in the above referenced papers, attempts to document the use-cases and example code snippets derived from extensive use of enumeration types with other programming languages that are currently used indescribably more widely than Fortran in chemical processing and manufacturing industry even in engineering and scientific technical/numerical domains and applications.  \"No magic numbers in code\" and type-safe programming are among the most basic aspects of the good coding practices (GCP) sought after by managers and technical leads toward computing in such industry.  But even in these aspects, Fortran falls short relative to other top programming languages today and this gap compounds the reasons why Fortran does not get considered for any large and/or new application developments.  It is therefore critically important the facility toward enumeration types in Fortran be developed comprehensively to support a wide spectrum of beneficial use cases in scientific and technical programming.  The section below strives  to list all the cases from industrial experience and to extract feature requirements from these examples so that the formal specifications toward this facility can be pursued.",

I was on the Data subcommittee where your paper got discussed --- if I remember well, we went over your paper and tried to extract useful things that were not part of the other proposal in #11. The issue was that there was apparently already an effort from Tokyo, as documented in #11, and your effort was not coordinated with them. Had we used github already, we would know about these efforts and could coordinate better.\nBy looking at the use cases and motivation at #11, I am not convinced that they have done due diligence to explore how other languages do that, nor many examples how enumeration is actually used in codes.\nEither way, let's start over, and discuss the use cases, then try to formulate what features the community would like and then try to create a solid proposal for the next meeting.\nI see several issues that the committee was trying to figure out, and we need to have good arguments why yes, or why not:\n\n\nShould you be able to assign values to enumerators? If so, only integers, or other things such as strings, floats, etc., per examples in 19-229.\n\n\nShould you be allowed to set some enumerators as private?\n\n\nShould enumerators be class 1 names?\n\n\nShould next / prev functions be added? (Swift does not seem to have it, neither does C or C++, as far as I know)\n\n\nThere was also a lot of discussion about syntax, some of which happened at the J3 mailinglist\n\n\nAre there other questions that we do not have agreement on?\nI would start thoroughly discussing these and find an agreement on these questions first, or at least list pros and cons. I noticed suggestions at the J3 mailinglist for not doing any work on this until our next meeting, when somehow it will be time for action. I think we should do the opposite -- we should try to do as much work as we can remotely, so that when we meet the next time, we either have a solid proposal, or solid lists of pros and cons, and we can vote what we want to do."

Most of the time you care less about what the actual value is than is it different from other values. As a first step to defining a full enumerator cabability I would do the following.\n\n\nRemove the BIND(C) requirement since it makes no sense if you aren't doing C interop.\n\n\nIf its decided that more intrinsic data types should be supported just add the ability to set the KIND with the enum statement, ie ENUM(KIND=INT64) or ENUM(KIND=REAL32)\n\n\nAllow enumerators to be named (Cray did this in its pre F2003 compilers and might still allow it as an extension) ie\nENUM(KIND=REA64) :: PiValues\nEnumerator :: PI=3.1415---, TWOPI=2*PI\nEnd Enumerator\n\n\nAdd capability to change/set the default increment\nENUM(KIND=REAL32, INCREMENT=3.0_REAL32) :: threeValues\nEnumerator :: THREE=3.0_REAL32, SIX, NINE, TWELVE\nEND ENUM\n\n\nThis addresses what I consider the first and most important (for me at least) of use case for enumerators.

Given Fortrans traditional focus on scientific and engineering programming, some of the use cases in other languages might not be appropriate. ..\n\nRe: other languages and what is appropriate or not, consider J3 Fortran paper 19-216r1 discussed at the Tokyo meeting which was the basis for crucial decision(s) by the WG5 body, decision(s) that might constrain and limit what will get introduced to Fortran 202X.  That paper mentions 4 other programming languages in its Introduction starting with C;  it also states, \"Pascal, Modula-2, Ada, ... have proper enumeration types, and enumerators of those types, because they are useful.\" and elsewhere in WG5/J3 documents it has been mentioned Fortran 202X shall have \"proper enumeration types\".\nNow, note in connection with Ada being mentioned in 19-216r1: one of the features under consideration toward enumeration types in Fortran is %NEXT ( or ..%NEXT()) ) and %PREV ( or ..%PREV() ) to loop over enumerators in a type instance.  This has similarities with facilities in Ada such as 'SUCC and 'PRED in Ada: see here. Few other languages support such as a facility with their enumeration types.\nI then ask:\n\n\nif certain languages such as C or Ada and their use cases are acceptable for consideration of feature design in Fortran, even for year 2022/2023 (!!), why not other languages?  Why not look wider say toward IEEE Spectrum and its current rankings toward the most widely used languages?  IEEE is, after all, among the largest organizations for engineers and applied scientists, if not THE biggest.  Also, if one is learning from other languages and their applications, why ignore recent and modern advancements?  C language is in \"maintenance mode\", Ada the same since 2012; do Pascal and Modula-2 need to be discussed?\n\n\nNow, also note Ada (dating even before the Ada-95 standard) supported the specification of values of enumerators and also character literals and boolean types in enumerations: see here and here.  Note my paper (19-229) does make use cases for character literals and logical types kinda like Ada in addition to integer and floating-point types which are supported, by the way, in Swift language.  However the disappointing situation is the Fortran proposal toward Fortran 202X will likely NOT support any of these aspects: if something does make it in, it'll likely be along the lines of following:\n\n\nenum :: CALC_SPEC\n   enumerator :: FUNC\n   enumerator :: FIRST_DERIV\n   enumerator :: SECOND_DERIV ! value = 4 (say) will not be allowed; Ada does\n   ..\nend enum\n\n\n\nSo if Ada is going to be used as a basis of one feature (e.g.,NEXT, PREV as explained above), then why not other aspects, particularly when these other aspects can be seen to be supported by other top lanaguages on the IEEE Spectrum and ALSO when I see there are modern applications in technical computing in industry that actually employ these enumeration type facilities to develop code that read so well and which are easier to maintain and improve over time as well?\n\n\nSo then, who really gets to decide use case X based on Ada is ok but use case Y from modern C++ or Java or C#, or use case X from Swift language are NOT acceptable?"

It seems that Ada is cherry-picked, and even that inconsistently, as you pointed out.\nNote that Ada seems to have succ and pred functions that work on other types such as integer (per \"'Succ and 'Pred work with any scalar type\" from here and per \"X'Succ(Y) is an Ada attribute where X is any discrete type and Y is a value of that type\" from here). As such it makes perfect sense to extend those to enumeration type also.\nIn case of Fortran, we do not have succ and prev and so it does not make sense to somehow for Enumeration to have those. The closest that Fortran has is nearest.\nSo given that, the \"natural\" position is not to have first, last, succ and pred.

Either the default behavior should be changed or a new syntax should be used. Here is my argumentation. (Note: this is a cross-post from another thread.)\nFirst, let me prefice that with what I consider the absolutely basic design feature I expect Fortran to have: prevent silent errors. So ugly syntax or not, what I personally get paid for is to get good numeric results.\nConsider the very root of such solutions, which probably is the familiar line\nimplicit none\nThe implicit typing feature was deemed to be unsafe and thus new, stricter rules for typing can be enabled with this switch. Please notice:\n\nif you omit the implicit none, the functionality of the code will not change\nif you use -fimplicit-none (or equivalent) switch, the functionality of the code will not change\n\nReading the code mid-file, you don't need to check the top of the file to see the implicit none. You just use the implicit typing and whether this mode is enabled or not, you will be good. Now if you start using implicit typing and implicit none was in effect, you will get a compiler error. All good.\nNow consider the proposed switch (let's stick to my favorite implicit save). For example:\nimplicit nosave\n\nIf you do that, the behavior of the code will change violently in a completely non-distinguishable way. Whenever you see:\ninteger :: i = 0\n\nyou have no idea whether i will be zero on each call or not. And worst of all, if you make a mistake, you will not be warned.\nNow when you work with different files, some of them written in 1980s, other in 2010s, you cannot just write right Fortran: you have to keep in mind which typing/saving/... rules are in place. Which is exactly the reason why implicit typing was deemed unsafe!\nAs much as I hate and despise this feature, I think we cannot provoke such situations. It must be clear looking at the code whether the variable is save or not. A couple of solutions have been proposed:\n\ninteger, nosave :: i = 0 -- IMO pain to type\ninteger, init :: i = 0 -- nicer to type on QWERTY keyboard\ninteger :: i := 0 -- or some other operator, such as =>. The good side is that there are no keywords that clutter the code.\n\nAny solution must be nice to type. This keyword/syntax will be used a lot. So I personally would prefer some operator-based syntax because having nosave every 3 lines would cause a lot of clutter, especially in editors with syntax highlighting. But the worst case init would be not that much pain."

And I also agree that things should not initialize automatically to 0.\nI also agree that this will mean that init will start popping all over the place. And by looking at how people use this feature, you can apparently use integer :: a, b, c = 2 in the main program, in module variable and in derived types already, and it will not imply save.\nGiven all this, I am now leaning towards simply making integer :: a, b, c = 2 to imply init.\nIn order to get this in, I think we have to have two proposals. One is to introduce init, and I think that integer, init :: a, b, c = 2 should mean that a is not initialized, even if it's slightly inconsistent. This proposal does not break backwards compatibility.\nThe reason is that we will have a second proposal that changes the syntax integer :: c = 2 to mean implied init instead of implied save. After this second proposal is in, you can simply go into your code and remove init and things will still work. This proposal would break backwards compatibility, and so again it probably must be done in two stages. First it will introduce implicit none(save), which will not break compatibility. Then a second proposal will make implicit none(save) the default. The very last proposal might not pass --- but that will come in the category of simply making implicit none(all) the default, which is a separate discussion (perhaps it will just be a compiler option that would be recommended to always use)."

However, I am not sure implicit none (*) (or any other alternatives) are good or clear enough:\nAbout the introduction of explicit all:\n\nFortran has had an implicit none statement for 30 years.  This is a statement that most Fortran developers are familiar with, since using it became one of the (if not the) most basic and generally applicable good practice for writing post-77 Fortran code.  I think it would be fair to call implicit none a well known part of the standard.\nFrom a linguistic point of view, I think most people would agree that the meanings of \"implicit none\" and \"explicit all\" are exactly the same.\nThe proposed explicit all statement, according to this thread and to #83, would mean something different to implicit none.\nI think this is a bad idea: it would be confusing to most existing developers, who might (quite reasonably) assume that explicit all was a \"modern\", completely equivalent syntax to the implicit none they know so well.\nThe addition of such an explicit all statement to the standard would create yet another new \"gotcha\" in the language due to historical reasons.\nIts effects to newcomers may not be particularly positive: who would feel attracted to learn a language where, say, public none and private all mean different things, with a story dating back to decades before you were born?\n\nAbout the introduction of implicit none (*) or other alternatives\n\nThis implicit none(*) syntax seems more in line with the changes to the implicit none statement made in the 2018 standard, where its optional spec-list was introduced.\n\nHowever, I share the concerns expressed elsewhere about changes to its meaning in future standards:\n\nimplicit none(*) by itself would be perfect in a world where the list of possible implicit-none-spec's never changed.\nUnfortunately we don't live in that world: just a few years after the standard first introduced the two currently possible implicit-none-spec's (external and type) there is discussion about the need to add a third one (nosave).\nThe nosave spec is not a problem in itself, since the implicit none (*) syntax would probably be introduced at the same time as the nosave spec, or later.\nThe problem is what will happen if in the future another implicit-none-spec is added to the standard: if the committee follows the approach suggested by @certik in #40 (comment) , where an expression (explicit all in his comment) refers to \"any future addition\" to the arguments to implicit none, then the meaning of implicit none (*) will depend on the version of the standard.  [The alternative would be that  implicit none meant the same as implicit none (<list of its three oldest specs>) but something different to implicit none (<list of all possible specs>), which is quite difficult to imagine.]\nIf the new implicit-none-spec meant that code using implicit none(*) needed to be changed in order to be valid and compile, that would be an acceptable problem: users would always notice that something is wrong, and they would be able to take action: they would probably be able to select an older standard in the compiler, or they could modernise the code.\nIf the new implicit-none-spec silently changed the behaviour of valid code (as will be the case with the nosave option), then that would probably be the point at which the version of the standard would need to be specified in the source code (implicit none (*=Fortran203z) or whatever)."

My proposal would be to add an INIT attribute and statement analogous to SAVE.  Local variables with the INIT attribute must be initialized and cannot have the SAVE attribute.  The attribute would not apply to dummy arguments (or really to anything that couldn't have SAVE).\nA bare INIT statement, like SAVE, would apply the INIT attribute to all variables to which it could apply.  This implies that a bare INIT would require an initializer for all local variables in the scope (apart from dummies, things with the SAVE attribute, &c.).\nAn INIT statement with variables may also initialize them, and they assume the types and shapes of their initializers.\nSo:\ninteger, init :: n1 = 1 ! n1 is 1 on each invocation, not `SAVE`\ninit :: n2 = 2 ! declares n2 as `INTEGER`, assigns it 2 on each invocation\ninit :: n3\ninteger :: n3 = 3 ! does NOT imply `SAVE` because n3 has `INIT`\ninit ! affects all variables not explicitly `SAVE`\ninteger :: n4 = 4 ! does NOT imply `SAVE` because of bare `INIT` above, which can't appear in old code\n\nEDIT: The SAVE statement would also accept initializers and infer types and shapes from them.\nEDIT: Obviously the initializers would be defined as expressions, not constant expressions, when INIT is in force, so clause 8.4 would need some rework.  Initialized local variables would be allowed to refer only to dummies, host- and use-associated entities, and previously declared local variables (with SAVE or initializers); i.e., no forward usage of the value of an initializer."

Then later, once I am done developing my subroutine, I can refactor the above code to (perhaps some auto formatting can do that):\ninteger :: a, b, d, e, f\ninteger, init :: c = 0\nreal(dp) :: x, y, z\nreal(dp), allocatable :: h(:,:), t(:)\n...\nA counter argument against adding init :: c = 0 is that one can do the same just by adding c = 0 code there as follows (which is shorter and can be done already):\ninteger :: a, b, c, d, e, f\nreal(dp) :: x, y, z\nreal(dp), allocatable :: h(:,:), t(:)\n...\nc = 0\nBut the downside is that the initialization is far from the declaration, while the init :: c = 0 allows the initialization to be right next to the declaration, which makes it much easier to later refactor into integer, init :: c = 0, as shown above."

One might have to add some explicit SAVE statements for those cases that really were meant to have the SAVE attribute, but eventually you'd get a clean compilation.

Having to specify save for every module variable, just because you specified implicit none(save) globally  would be a pain. (And I would hate to specify implicit none(save) in each routine just to avoid its effect on module variables as well.) Additionally, it is not clear to me, what a non-initialized module variable would mean, if implicit none(save) is in effect, as in\nmodule testmod\n  implicit none(save)\n\n  integer :: somevar\n\nend module testmod\n\nWould this variable get lost if the module \"goes out of scope\"?\nAs for 2: I agree with @certik , allowing the init statement would mean, you can write\nmodule testmod\n  init\n\ncontains\n\n  subroutine test()\n     integer :: n = 3\n  end subroutine test\n\nend module testmod\n\nThen, we are back to the original proposal, that adding some module level keyword changes code behavior further down.

Furthermore it would be basically equivalent the original proposal to let implicit none(save) turn all assignments at a declaration into a non-saved assignment, but doing it more complicated (with two keywords instead of one).

If it is a local variable of a subprogram it is shared by all instances (15.6.2.4) of the subprogram.\n\nIf this is the definition, then it makes no sense for module variables or the main program because there is no end or return.\nWhat exactly does this mean:\n\nA variable, common block, or procedure pointer declared in the scoping unit of a main program, module, or submodule implicitly has the SAVE attribute,\n\nbecause they didn't define what save means in this case...\nUnless somebody can clarify that, I will continue assuming that module level and program variables do not have save attribute, because it makes no sense.

The first Cray-1 systems only had a megabyte of SRAM memory (131,072 64-bit words) without virtual paging so we had to use all kinds of overlay tricks with data (and code!) to make stuff fit.

It is of course quite obvious how to write a preprocessor that would repeat the clause for each item in the list.

However, I am in favor of getting completely rid of such \"downcasting\" as it is called in other languages and to not ever have to use it at all.\nSelect type statements are just a nasty symptom, and not the actual disease. The disease is that Fortran presently does not support any form of multiple inheritance. If we had Java-like interface inheritance (or traits as they have been called in Issue #125) in addition to implementation inheritance (the one that present Fortran provides), there would be no need to use \"select type\". The same would hold if we had C++ like multiple inheritance.\nIt is the conflict between having to conform to some extended type's interface while at the same time wishing to inherit implementation from a base type that typically leads to the use of \"select type\" statements."

            "text": "I submitted this paper 19-186 for the joint WG5/J3 meeting in Tokyo (August 5 - 9, 2019) but the paper was ignored on account of the worklist for Fortran 202X being closed.  I don't know how to get it considered now for Fortran 202Y, perhaps various \"thumbs up\" by readers here might help push its case?\nIntroduction\n18-007r1 states in section 7.5.7.1 Extensible, extended, and abstract types, \"A derived type, other than the type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING, that 7 does not have the BIND attribute or the SEQUENCE attribute is an extensible type.\"  An extension type can thus be derived from any other user derived type which does not have the BIND or the SEQUENCE attributes.\nConsider a user derived type in Fortran that does not have the BIND or the SEQUENCE attributes and which is employed toward calculational needs involving data structures of some complexity in scientific and technical computing, particulary in industry: the allowance per current standard to extend said type is a matter of great concern in terms of security and predictability of computer operations and results, especially to senior software design architects, computational technology leaders, and budget and business managers.\nThe facility in current Fortran standard to be able to extend all derived types except as stated above makes it feasible, at least conceptually, to manipulate the data and states of objects of such types and to corrupt or otherwise misuse them via type extension, either intentionally or unknowingly.  It then becomes difficult, if not impossible, to develop technical software involving specialized derived types because it leaves open the possibility of violation of a technical/business understanding across or within teams not to override some type behavior or functionality via type inheritance.\nThis situation hinders the adoption of Fortran in new engineering and/or scientific software projects where the design paradigm of object-orientation is important but where the needs of the projects also include the requirement to encapsulate the business/technical logic using data structures which are 'sealed' so that objects of such structures can then be consumed across the  program or libraries without concern of easy alteration.\nIn addition to the above-stated use case of added security and reliability of a 'sealed' derived type, it is also expected that a few or all of the processor implementations will be able to provide some performance benefit with the use of bound procedures with such 'sealed' types.  This is on account of some or all processors succeeding in providing more efficient code via nonpolymorphic descriptors of the passed-object dummy argument utilized in procedure calls.",

All I wanted is some general feedback \"yes, submit a full proposal\" or \"no, not worth it\".\nAs a solution, I think we need the committee to consider all proposals not just for 202x, but for 202y also, all the time, so that we can push all proposals forward (or not if they get rejected), but what we do not want is to wait the next several years until to even consider 202y proposals.

It's a basic need in object-oriented (OO) inheritance scheme after all that so many OO languages offer such support.  Avoidance of \"deep inheritance hierarchies\" is increasingly a compelling design consideration and involves a strong business need when it comes to encapsulation, development, and utilization of knowledge frameworks in any domain.  Many now seek to design 'classes' and use them but without the travails of inheritance.\nIt'll really help those among my acquaintance develop code with better 'insurance' toward program vulnerabilities if such a low-cost facility were added to Fortran - the idea of an inextensible type already exists in the standard, the wiring is mostly there, and the feature mainly requires only EDITS.  In addition, such a facility can really free up compiler implementations to optimize instructions on data components of derived types operated via type-bound procedures (TBPs) by no longer having to be mindful of possible polymorphic nature of the passed dummy object.  One just has to look at some commercial implementations out there (clue: xxxxx inside) to see how guarded and conservative they are at the moment with TBPs when it comes to optimization.\nThere are other aspects as well which become cleaner with inextensible derived types e.g., finalization because Fortran, similar to C++, does not allow 'virtual destructirs' (the dummy argument is TYPE(..) with INTENT(INOUT)( that then doesn't provide any kind of a 'guard rail' when it comes to enforcing any finalizer discipline by extension types.\nA question is how much of a benefits case does one have to make for a reasonable group of 'modern' Fortranners to extend (pun intended!) support for this proposal!?"

That means that discussing and working on new features, such as those proposed in this repository, is very slow.\nA more efficient way would be to release a standard every 3 years on a set schedule.

I strongly agree and wonder what can we do about it. On one side, it seems to be the reality of things:\n\nCommittees are slow\nBusinesses follow money\nCompiler developers are scarce\n\nOn the other side, this is the Fortran development model we've grown up with and know, but there may be another path forward (complementary to the existing, not replacing it!).\nI'm rambling now and going a bit off topic, but how feasible do you all think it is to plan for the long term to have a open source reference implementation of Fortran? This would include something like:\n\nAn open source compiler + interpreter (remember that compiled/interpreted is not a property of the language but of the implementation!) that mirrors the development of the language;\nAllow implementing and testing experimental features and proposals, which would make it easier to evaluate in practice (both ease of use and performance), and to argue for to the committee;\nHave a \"master\" branch of the language that evolves fast and in short cycles; The committee reviews proposals as usual, and releases \"tags\" or 3/5/whatever - yearly standard releases of the language.\n\nI think Rust follows a similar model. The language is open source and has a reference implementation. If you check out the master, you get whatever is latest. There are also versioned stable releases (1.38.0 current). And then there are editions -- Rust 2015, Rust 2018 (analogous to Fortran standard releases). Developers who need the rock solid stuff use editions; those who want to experiment or want the bleeding edge use nightly or latest versioned build. I think it's an elegant model.\nThis warrants a separate issue (again, sorry for hijacking), and I'd be happy to write one soon, but for now just probing the temperature of people here."

I personally am not very convinced (yet) in this particular case.\nOne thing that I would like us to formulate are general rules of what features should not go into Fortran. For example, we probably do not want to make Fortran another C++ by simply adding every feature that is in C++ (or Python). One huge advantage of Fortran is that it is (still) a very simple language. What you see is (typically) exactly what happens. We would lose some of that with syntax like bar%foo = val * 2, which ultimately does make it just a little bit harder to learn (with every such feature). I guess it depends what direction we want Fortran to go. And having some kind of general guidelines that we all agree on would help I think.\nUltimately that's why there is a committee, so it does not really matter what I think personally, but I am just posting here to discuss the possible negatives of such a proposal."

Array-like syntax would be the most natural, but obviously conflicts with, er, array syntax.    And square brackets have already been coopted for coarrays.    So I'm thinking something like curly braces or \"@\":\nmy_obj{idx} = expr\nmy_obj@(idx) = expr\nNote that something like the latter syntax is likely going to emerge in F202X for a different purpose:  rank-agnostic array references."

In order to ensure future changes won't break the API, currently all derived type components should be declared private and then accessors added for those meant to be publicly available. For large derived types this is extremely tedious, especially given the verbosity of Fortran. Because intrinsic getters and setters make a function call and direct access to the variable syntactically indistinguishable, that means the API can be preserved even if a previously public component is made private or outright removed from the derived type.\nThis allows for considerable time savings when writing code and reduction in the amount of boilerplate which is needed. In addition to making the programmer's life easier, this also makes them more productive and therefore improves Fortran's reliability as a language. The problem which Fortran currently runs into is that it takes significantly longer to write the same program in it than in Python (or other, higher-level languages). While it will certainly run faster, in most use-cases a programmer's time costs more than computational run-time. As such, we increasingly see people moving towards wrapping bits of legacy Fortran code with f2py while writing the rest of their software in Python. If we wish to preserve the viability of Fortran as a language we must take steps to improve productivity in it.\nThe fact that future-proofing the API requires the programmer to write trivial getters/setters even when they are not strictly necessary also impacts on performance. There will be the overhead of an extra function call, especially when the type-bound-procedure is not nonoverrideable and requires consulting a vtable. Functions which return polymorphic variables or (if I am not mistaken) a dynamic array do not tend to get optimised into subroutines by the compiler. This means that two assignments will tend to occur (first to the return variable in the function, then to whatever the function result is assigned to in the calling procedure) and possibly two memory allocations as well."

I think I am not an enthusiastic \"fan\" of OO, but still think that the above merit of self-management very useful (and indeed helped my coding a lot).\nSo, although it is not clear what is a best improved syntax (if any), I guess it would be nice if some new syntax/facility makes such coding easier (and hopefully less verbose)."

Parnas had explained that 16 years earlier.\nThere is no syntax conflict. Processors can already work out the difference between function and array references. Setters would not be a new problem.

An example of what I have in mind is something along the lines of\n\ntype :: matrix\n  real, allocatable :: A(:,:)\n  integer, property :: rows = size(matrix%A,1)  ! a read-only property\n  integer, property :: cols = size(matrix%A,2)   ! a read-only property\ncontains\n  procedure :: get_nrows  !

The gfortran documentation says that size() will only return a meaningful result for an allocated array. On the other hand ifort appears to return 0 as the size of unallocated objects.

I realise that the ideas may not have been formulated as clearly as required.\nproposal_templates.pdf",

The one thing you need to take care of when putting several instantiations into one module is to make sure that types (and variables and ...) have unique names. Hm, intriguing: should that be a problem to be solved by designging the language feature in that way or by the user (on the principle of \"caveat emptor\")?"

I suppose one way to approach this would be to simply define multiple generic types with the same contract but different names. That would work fine for types without any required components or type-bound procedures but would become repetitive for more complex generic types.\nAnother issue is that this approach only allows you to define the components and type-bound procedures required for the generic type. You can't require any non-type-bound procedures to take it as an argument.\nFinally, any (non-type-bound) procedures would have to be renames if they are to share a scope with another instantiation of the template. I'd suggest some means of automatically making this happen and creating a generic interface for the procedures."

However, they are different things. I'm not convinced that it is appropriate to replace a map a type/kind combo to a generic type, as you show in a number of your examples.

                    "text": "I've been thinking a bit about the Fortran type system. In a language like C++, a variable's type encapsulates the sort of data it stores (int, uint, string, etc., with each of these corresponding to a unique kind), whether it's a pointer, whether it's an array, etc. In Fortran, there are really four different aspects to the type system, each of which is somewhat independent:\n\ntype (integer, real, derived type, etc): either known at compile time or deferred until run-time using polymorphism\nkind (how a particular type is stored in memory): must be known at compile time\nrank (number of dimensions of an array): until recently had to be known at compile time, but now can be deferred to run-time using the assumed-rank feature. Unlike type and len, however, it can not be dynamically allocated at run-time, making it more like old-fashioned assumed-size arrays rather than modern assumed-shape arrays\nlen/size (number of elements in each dimension of an array): can be deferred to run-time\n\nParameterised derived types take care of kind and len, where the latter can be deferred until run-time but the former must be known at compile-time. That severely limits the usefulness of parameterising the kinds in a type, because every combination of kind values requires its own implementation of a procedure which takes that type as an argument. And just to make it all the more confusing, unlimited polymorphic variables are able to take on any kind that the user wants, despite polymorphism really being about the type and not the kind.\nTemplates/generic programming in a language like C++ are conceptually fairly straightforward. While the code is written in such a way that it does not state the exact type (which, as we said, contains the information on the kind, rank, len) of the data it is operating on, all of this information will be available at compile-time. I don't think anyone has adequately considered how templates in Fortran should deal with the fact that there are really (up to) four pieces of information they need to know about, rather than one like in C++. Worse, the way these pieces of information are currently handled by the compiler are not really consistent, with some needing to be known at compile-time and others put off until run-time under certain circumstances.\nMy feeling is that we're going to need to step back somewhat if we are to consider how best to make generic programming work within the type-system as a whole. Perhaps we should think about introducing \"assumed-kind\" variables and a select kind construct. This could be modelled after the assumed-rank feature, with similar restrictions in place. (More ambitiously, we could think about making both rank and kind dynamically allocatable, I suppose, although I don't think that would be necessary for what I'm thinking about here). There need not be any additional run-time overhead, as the compiler could generate all necessary combinations of kind-parameters for a type or procedure at compile-time.\nLet's say that derived types could then be parameterised on rank and that len parameters could then be a 1-D array:\ntype :: foo(r, s)\n  integer, rank :: r = 2\n  integer, dimension(r), len :: s = [3, 5]\n  real, dimension(s) :: bar\nend type foo\n(Note that it remains unclear as to exactly how we'd handle allocatable/pointer arrays of parameterized rank, in that case.)\nWith those changes we could eliminate some of the inconsistency within the Fortran type system. At that point it starts to become easier to think about how we do the same for the type itself through templating. I think parameterised modules (with the inclusion of some sort of type parameter), the addition of a type-parameter to derived types, and/or (potentially parameterised) generic types described above might be able to handle it."

Your proposal looks like it might be a workable first step to templates and to me fits into current Fortran syntax etc. better than some of the other proposals I've seen. One idea that i had as a first step to a generic container was an extension of parameterized types to allow the syntax introduced in F2008 that allowed the type statement to define intrinisic variables to be allowed in the definition of the PDT but with an associated modification to the underlying KIND parameter facility to make it truly generic (syntax wise). Specifically, in F2008 you can do the following to define a double precision variable\nUSE ISO_FORTRAN_ENV\nType(REAL(REAL64)) :: areal\nIdeally you would want to be able to just write\nType(REAL64) :: areal\nUnfortunately, because the standard does not mandate that KIND parameters be unique in the sense that the values returned by the SELECTED_REAL, SELECTED_INT, and KIND functions along with the intrinsic parameters in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV are never the same value. Currently I think the majority of compilers will return 4 for both KIND(1) and KIND(1.0) plus INT64 and REAL64 are both 8. If the values were unique then for me parameterized types become a little more generic because I can do the following\nType :: genval(listkind)\nInteger(kind) :: listkind\nType(listkind) :: aval\nEnd Type\nwithout having to create a separate type for each intrinsic value.\nThe only reason I can see that the current KIND facility doesn't mandate unique values is to placate people who still (foolishly) insist on doing\nReal(8) :: areal\nInteger(8) :: aint\nHowever, I can't see any reason that the values returned by the various KIND setting functions and the intrinsic values in ISO_FORTAN_ENV can't be unique and still support the old Real(8) syntax. For the functions etc. just let the kind values returned for each intrinsic type live in a predefined range (ie. integers live in 100-199, reals in 200-299 etc).\nThese modifications would help to address support for containers with intrinsic values but still leave open how you support user defined types in a similar manner. I would like to hear others ideas on how the compiler might do this. And has been pointed out, you still have the len parameter issue that prevents PDT's from being statically polymorphic which is what templates are really all about."

Support for character strings might take a little more thought. There is support for deferred length strings etc for PDTs but how to fit that into a truly generic framework is something we can discuss.  The big issue is how do you support user defined types using just the kind parameters. There are obviously a lot of other issues that need to be addressed but I think what I'm proposing is a tiny first step that builds on current Fortran syntax and gives programmers another option besides using unlimited polymorphic variables (I've done this for lists, trees, hashmaps etc and its not pretty) or relying on preprocessor tricks to emulate templates."

During the execution of the procedure it is pointer associated with the actual argument\" known colloquially as \"automatic pointer targetting\" or auto-targetting which, if I'm not mistaken, complemented a previous mod (Fortran 2003?) where an actual argument without the TARGET attribute can be used with a dummy argument with one.  I think what you suggest can loosely be placed in these categories..\nObjections for such matters are often attributed to the invisible/indeterminable/intangible compiler benefits or lack thereof with optimization.

Therefore, the constraints a target attribute puts on a specific component, would have to be applied to all of them. To me, it is more logical then to specify the target attribute for the entire derived type instead for its components, as it is now."

This prevents type-bound function calls being performed on function results, as can be done in pretty much every other object-oriented language. Thus, the following code is illegal:\nvar = object%get_another_object()%get_yet_another()\nInstead, something along the lines of\ntmp = object%get_another_object()\nvar = tmp%get_yet_another()\nis required. This is more verbose, especially as you try to chain more and more function calls together. Is there any reason for this restriction?\nI would propose changing this. The definition of proc-component-ref could stay the same as before:\nR1039  proc-component-ref        is  scalar-variable % procedure-component-name\n\nbut C1027 (\"the scalar-variable shall be a data-ref that is not a coindexed object\") would be amended to\n\nthe scalar-variable shall not be a coindexed object.",

That was one of the reason why I joined the committee (and I invite you to join as well if you can). What I found out is that the committee is composed of very nice and reasonable people that really care about Fortran, but sometimes the priorities are not well aligned with what should be done. That is one of the goals of this repository for us to brainstorm what we want to get done, and then pick the top 3 to 5 issues and prioritize them at the committee. For example this very issue, as well as #1 are issues that keep bothering me, but I kind of got used to them and so I am very happy that they got brought up, as I think those are some of the low hanging fruits to fix, which might not be that difficult to get agreement in the committee to fix."

In fact, my experience was that it is easier to allow the parser to process that than to try writing a grammar that restricts it. While I see that the LFortran grammar would not accept chaining function results together like this, it also can not recognize all allowable calls to type-bound functions. The standard specifcies that something like\na = object%array_component(1)%function_call(1.5, 2.0)\nis valid. It is far simpler to write a grammar which can recognize that and chaining together function results than one which can only recognize calling a type-bound function after array access.\nI'm currently away from my laptop, where I've been experimenting with a grammar, but once I'm back home this evening I can post the relevant portion of it."

If results of a function can be used, then that could allow things like:\ndiag(A) = 1\n\n..\n\n@certik,\nWith respect to all the issues being reported here, you are an excellent moderator in bringing all the sides to the discussion like in your response to @jacobwilliams above.  Hats off to you for that!  I often allow my own frustration with Fortran to \"boil over\" and among my reasons for that include what I believe are the inconsistencies in both the semantics offered in the current version standard wrt the objections raised for new facilities as well as the disconnects in the work process to get new items added to the language like those in the list for Fortran 202X (more on this later elsewhere).\nBy the inconsistency in semantics, you will know the language already allows instructions such as\n   diag(A) = 1\n\nIt's just that certain conditions need to be met which are essentially that A must either be a simply contiguous target or a contiguous pointer.  Here's an example:\n   integer, parameter :: N = 3\n   integer, target :: A(N,N) !<-- mat is \"simply contiguous\"\n   integer :: i, j\n\n   A = reshape( [( (10*j + i, i=1,N ), j=1,N) ], [N, N])\n   print *, \"A before diagonal reset:\"\n   do i = 1, size(A,dim=1)\n      print \"(*(g0,1x))\", A(:,i)\n   end do\n\n   diag(A) = 1\n\n   print *, \"A after the diagonal reset to unity:\"\n   do i = 1, size(A,dim=1)\n      print \"(*(g0,1x))\", A(:,i)\n   end do\n\ncontains\n\n   function diag(Mat) result(r)\n\n      ! Argument list\n      integer, contiguous, target :: Mat(:,:)\n      ! Function result\n      integer, pointer :: r(:)\n\n      ! Local variables\n      integer, pointer :: FlattenedMat(:)\n\n      ! Flatten the matix\n      FlattenedMat(1:size(Mat,dim=1)*size(Mat,dim=2)) => Mat\n      r => FlattenedMat(::size(A,dim=1)+1)\n\n      return\n\n   end function\n\nend\n\nNow gfortran does not support the above example, but I believe it is standard-conforming and it works with another compiler.  Upon execution, the above example produces:\n A before diagonal reset:\n11 12 13\n21 22 23\n31 32 33\n A after the diagonal reset to unity:\n1 12 13\n21 1 23\n31 32 1\n\nSo my point is several of the concepts, semantics, and syntax e.g., auto-targeting,  references (pointers) in any variable-definition context, etc. which can help what's being in the proposed in the original post here have already made it into the standard.\nThus in my mind the objections such as those that lead to rejections of the paper 18-134 are either half-baked or non-technical or both and it's only Fortran that suffers.  It's a race out there and lots and lots of codebases are permanently being lost to Fortran.\nThings are getting too far delayed needlessly and features delayed are features denied to persevering practitioners of Fortran.\nHence my constant refrain to accelerate certain aspects of the standard development and to establish better and more CONSISTENT and OBJECTIVE criteria to guide the development of the standard.  Among these must be the idea to limit the objections by processor implementors on non-technical grounds (e.g., scope) until and unless they are firmly \"holding their own feet to the fire\" in terms of achieving standard-compliance per some reasonable schedule.  Right now it's having both ways \"have your cake and eat it too\": implementations will not promise nor adhere to any schedule in terms of compliance (it can take decades to get a feature in) but yet get to override good proposals on the basis of scope.  That does not seem fair in any way to all the Fortranners out there.\nAnyways, yours and @zjibben's initiative with GitHub here is an excellent step in the right direction."

            "text": "Ideal Plan\nHere is a proposal that I would like to get feedback on and discuss. This is my idea how this GitHub repository can work.\nHow Opensource Works\nSuccessful open source projects, such as SymPy that I started 13 years ago, have:\n\none or two owners/leaders\n10-20 core developers with push access, those people can merge GitHub Pull\nRequests (PRs)\nhundreds of people who contribute PRs\nthousands of people who open issues and discuss them\n\nHow the Fortran Committee Could Work\nThe Fortran Standards document is compiled from LaTeX source code, and\nproposals that eventually get approved must be of very high quality and must\nsucceed multiple rounds of approvals. Fundamentally this is no different to\nopensource development.\nHere is how it could work:\n\n\nThe J3 committee chair and the WG5 committee chair are the two owners/leaders\n\n\nThe J3 and WG5 comittee voting members are the core developers, who approve\nproposals in the same way they currently do (the proposal must be submited at\nthe J3 website, then advocated at the committee, and eventually approved).\n\n\nHundreds of people use this GitHub repository to submit PRs, where each PR is\na particular proposal. We all collaborate on the PRs, and if it gets merged,\nit means that the proposal is of very high quality and is worth for the\ncommittee to spend their time to consider it. We use issues to track how the\nproposal gets processed by the committee and either approved or rejected. We\nsend further PRs to improve upon it based on the committee feedback.\n\n\nThousands of people open issues to propose new features and discuss them.\n\n\nAnybody can create a PR to try to create a proposal. Only members of the\ncommittee have push access (are allowed to merge PRs) and if they merge a PR,\nthey are responsible to advocate for it at the committee and collect the\ncommitee's feedback.\n\n\nThe committee itself does not need to change at all how it works, members of\nthe committee who do not have time or interest to be involved at GitHub do\nnot need to. For this plan to work, just several members of the committee\nneed to be actively involved (we already have 3 or 4 members who are\ninvolved, and that is enough to get us started). As this GitHub repository\nbecomes more popular, I can imagine eventually all members of the committee\nto at least read some of the responses and activity and what issues are\npopular.\n\n\nThe whole community works on PRs and essentially works nonstop (with hundreds\nof people in all time zones one gets a new PR every couple days, as in\nSymPy). That way, when the committee meets, it has high quality proposals to\nconsider, and it does not need to spend precious committee time to develop\nhigh quality proposals, because that work is outsourced to the wide\ncommunity.\n\n\nThe core developers (committee members) are the ones who ultimately decide\nwhat goes in, and what does not. Just like now. The only thing that changes\nis that the workflow becomes more efficient.\n\n\n\nSome lessons from open source development that will apply here:\n\n\nIf we are successful, we will get thousands of issues from people all over\nthe world. Some good, some not as high quality. People will discuss issues.\nInitially, many will be frustrated at how slow the committee works. The best\nreaction that we can do is to encourage people to create PRs and try to\ncreate high quality proposals for the issue(s) that they care about. And\ninvite them to collaborate on the PRs.\n\n\nExperience shows that this scales really well. We build a team. People start\nfeeling positive about the future, because their voice is heard, and their\nwork (in PRs) is used and their (small or large) contributions help shape the\nfuture of Fortran.",

So that when the committee meets in person, the simple stuff is already done, all the pros / cons are written up, and we can spend our time weighting the alternatives, as opposed to wasting time discussing things that could have been done beforehand at GitHub (such as that the proposal needs more examples).\nI've seen how the committee works and the most common objections, and I can now ask a lot of them myself and ensure each proposal meets a minimal level of quality here at GitHub.\nA related problem is that the committee only has a few members who are true experts on almost everything in the Fortran language. Most, including myself, only know some parts of Fortran really well, and not so some other parts. So by getting feedback from lots of people about a proposal at GitHub, asking lots of questions and discussing it here, we can iteratively improve the proposal to the level that an expert committee member would write right away. I have seen that happen just last week --- we spent an hour discussing pros and cons of various approaches, eventually agreeing on an approach that neither of us liked at first, but after doing the work, it seemed like the best solution --- and in the meantime an expert committee member sent us an email with exactly the same solution, that he intuitively figured out on his own."

My impression of this repository at its conception (even before reading this issue) was that it would allow the community to propose and discuss changes to the language in an organized, centralized, and streamlined way. GitHub provides tools to do exactly that.\nMaintainers of the repository being committee members allows them to communicate these proposals to the rest of the committee and have them considered for adoption. As Ondrej put it, it's an outward facing interface to the committee, and that's how I understood it from the get go.\nNothing about the workflow seems to suggest about how the committee should operate -- that's already in place. Other committee members may or may not choose to participate. However I'd be surprised if most chose not to participate despite this repo churning out a few high-quality proposals or more. Community needs not fight the committee. It just needs to create enough great stuff that it'd be hard to ignore it.\nI suggest to carefully put together a separate document in this repo (perhaps GUIDELINES.md) that would describe in detail how can Joe Fortran Programmer who stumbles upon this repo contribute a high quality proposal that could land onto the committee table at a meeting. Some is already in README.md (great work), and a nice proposal layed out by Ondrej in this issue."

If not, to what extent does WG5 think it is a problem?\n\n\nIf the answer to 2) is yes, other than the 2018 survey what does WG5 do to listen to these practitioners on a continual basis?\n\n\nWhat is up with \"national bodies\" in WG5 in this day and age?\n\n\nIf at all there must be national bodies - like US (with J3), UK, and Japan, to what extent are non-institutional practitioners residing in these nations represented in these 3 bodies?\n\n\nWhat about other national bodies or lack thereof?  What about a Fortranner in Brazil or France or Germany or India or Nigeria and how do these Fortranners' inputs get attention from WG5, particularly if they do not have any institutional support toward any ISO IEC advocacy or charter or means to get such support?  This goes back to question 1.\n\n\nMany of the practitioners in 2) are unhappy with the slow pace of Fortran language advancement and their feedback in WG5 survey appears to be mostly ignored in Fortran 202X work-list per J3, as seen in comp.lang.fortran threads, example here  and here.  What does WG5 plan to do about this?\n\n\nNow the two national bodies of UK and Japan have proposed further slowing down the pace and scope of Fortran standard revision due to insufficient processor support - this runs counter to majority views in WG5 survey as well as UK survey and comp.lang..fortran threads and now GitHub.  What does WG5 plan to address such differences in opinion?  See question 9 below re: this.\n\n\nIf WG5 accepts at face value the proposals by UK  and Japan, what are the criteria in terms of processor support toward current standard 2018?  How many processors must offer Fortran 2018 support to consider it good coverage?  Is it 2 or 5 or 10?  Which ones?\n\n\nIf there are practitioners of Fortran who wish for faster standardization of Fortran language features now and/or have needs for inclusion of more items than that intended by J3 in the work-list for Fortran 202X, what does WG5 itself propose that can be pursued to address such a need?\n\n\nBottom-line: I am strongly inclined to pose the above basic but important questions and user needs with WG5 and give WG5 some space and time to respond, rather than develop any proposals or documents toward any plans or workflows at this stage."

To be blunt and frank, gaining of a genuine acceptance among the top influencers on WG5 and J3 of such a need i.e., to be \"more efficient\" is in and of itself a HUUUGE challenge.  And it will only be by a broad consideration of Diversity (of thought in terms of needs of many coders) and concern toward Inclusivity of a wider group of Fortranners to ensure their voices are consistently and sufficiently represented that WG5 and J3 can come to support and embrace the approach to do more faster.  It is with this in mind the 10 or more questions like the ones upthread become important.  Without a discussion along such lines and contemplation toward the underlying, a focus on efficiency will entirely lack any passion nor gain any urgency - things will just remain the way they are and circular arguments will defeat any change.\nNote there is a certain mass of Fortranners in the \"national\" agencies and in other institutional areas and also certain sectors elsewhere for whom status quo is either \"just fine\" or who even question or oppose revisions beyond FORTRAN 77 (but use extensions) or Fortran 90 (but want some HPC features , or especially Fortran 95 (but want improvements to ALLOCATABLEs).  The needs of those in this \"camp\" are adequately met by the current situation.  So then one can argue why bother changing anything, things are good as they are.\nConsider ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG23 - Programming Language Vulnerabilities and what they write about Fortran in their document: in their last section 8 Implications for standardization, their last sentence is, \"Identifying, deprecating, and replacing features whose use is problematic where there is a safer and clearer alternative in the modern revisions of the language or in current practice in other languages.\"\nIt is only when one is willing to look at Fortran language more broadly and by paying close attention to \"other\" coders (besides the institutional ones) and \"other\" languages more intently one can have the motivation and impetus to be \"more efficient\".

            "text": "This is a somewhat unusual feature request, but Cray's new parallel language Chapel has an interesting approach to providing a command line interface. The programmer can define \"config variables\" and these can be set by command-line flags when executing the program (or take a default value). Parameters can also be config, in which case they can be specified to the compiler, much like macro definitions to the preprocessor. I thought this was a really clever, simple way to program a CLI. In Fortran config could just be an attribute of a variable, giving a syntax along the lines of\nprogram hello_world\n  implicit none\n  integer, config :: n = 5\n  integer :: i\n  do i = 1, n\n    print*, \"Hello world\"\n  end do\nend program hello_world\nThen, at execution,\n./hello_world\n# Hello world\n# Hello world\n# Hello world\n# Hello world\n# Hello world\n\n./hello_world -n=2\n# Hello world\n# Hello world\n\nSome tricky issues to consider:\n\nHow to deal with array variables? Have the user pass in an array constructor on the CLI?\nShould the config attribute the allowed in any program unit or only in an actual program? (I don't see an issue with allowing them anywhere, but I may be missing something.)\nIf config variables are allowed in procedures or modules, presumably it should automatically confer the save attribute\nShould config parameters be allowed? I'd be inclined to support this but it would require the compiler to accept the values as command-line arguments.\nShould the config attribute be restricted to intrinsic types or could it be allowed for derived types as well? If so, how would these be set? Using the builtin constructor? What about component permissions, in that case?\nThere are some similarities between this concept and namelists, so perhaps it would be better to model this functionality on them.",

Processors can then implement whatever \"magic\" they think appropriate behind the scenes to support the facilities.  Examples include generic intrinsic procedures, derived types for interoperability with C, etc.  Thus there is no reason why an intrinsic STRING type cannot be introduced featuring considerable benefits for the practitioners of the language, and which should be the overriding motivation, in a manner that might at first appear alien to a user derived types e.g., an inextensible, single-component only container type for a new intrinsic string type which offers an \"(x:y)\" operator which aren't possible today with user derived types!\nOn the other hand, the problem with CHARACTER type is it's really at the point of being immutable, any further change to it can adversely impact some compiler implementation or other.  The resistance to any change here will be great.\nBut also, there is the issue of ARRAY semantics in Fortran which, per its original design, calls for symmetry and shies away from jagged structures.  So this is yet another issue when it comes to user needs for arrays of strings.\nThus, the best compromise in my opinion is a new string type which builds on the capabilities of current CHARACTER type but also offers further benefits for coders."

An intrinsic string type appears to fall under this category.\nBeing able to code \"string s = 'Hello World!'\" conveys certain sense of ease-of-use and modernity which is not quite measurable but which I think is priceless.  One just loses many a sharp mind at \"character(len=:), allocatable ..\".  One can then build many a \"field of dreams\" with coarrays (an enormous amount of committee resources were expended on it), etc. in Fortran, but \"they\" rarely come to experience any of that ..\nOne can accept the argument Fortran does not necessarily need to include as a top priority feature \"in the compiler\", say, containers of the likes of C++ STL like deques and priority_queues and unordered multimaps, etc.  A vision for Fortran to offer better intrinsic capabilities (e.g., generics) at some point so coders can \"home brew\" their own libraries toward such capabilities may be ok right now.\nBut with a string type, an intrinsic capability is badly needed for Fortran's credibility.  And it doesn't seem all that difficult, almost all the heavy-lifting was already done with Part 2 of the standard with ISO_FORTRAN_STRING.  Part 2 is now effectively gone.  It's mostly a matter of merging into Part 1 a modernized version of it.\nHowever if every item, no matter how well-established in programming parlance, becomes too difficult to get added to Fortran and requires endless discussions and iterations on use cases, requirements, specifications, and syntax, then perhaps it's time for someone to contact INCITS and \"pull the plug\" on Fortran."

If declaring a dummy argument as optional, the user must:\n\nManually make appropriate checks about whether the actual argument is provided by the caller;\nUse a separate variable inside the procedure because the code must not reference the optional dummy argument if not present.\n\nExample\nExample of a quadratic function that optionally allows evaluation of its linear form:\nreal function quadratic(x, a, b, c)  \n  ! returns a + b * x + c * x**2 if c is present and a + b * x otherwise\n  real, intent(in) :: x, a, b\n  real, intent(in), optional :: c\n  real :: c_tmp ! use separate variable to avoid referencing non-present arg\n  if (present(c)) then\n    c_tmp = c\n  else\n    c_tmp = 0 ! default value if c is not present\n  end if\n  quadratic = a + b * x + c_tmp * x**2\nend function quadratic\nChecking for presence of the optional argument and using a temporary variable is cumbersome and error-prone, and it is even more so if the same needs to be done for many optional arguments.\nSolution\nAllow setting the default value of the optional argument in the function (or subroutine) statement by using the assignment operator =:\nreal function quadratic(x, a, b, c=0)\n  ! returns a + b * x + c * x**2 if c is present and a + b * x otherwise\n  real, intent(in) :: x, a, b\n  real, intent(in), optional :: c\n  quadratic = a + b * x + c * x**2\nend function quadratic\nThis is similar to how Python keyword arguments are defined.\nComments\n\nThe proposed syntax is complementary to the existing syntax, that is, it doesn't break existing code;\nIts style is more or less Fortranic and consistent with other syntax elements;\nSame syntax as Python keyword args, so it would be intuitive to Python developers learning Fortran;\nCould be implemented completely as a pre-processor, for a proof-of-concept.",

                    "text": "Yes I am in.\nWhile we are here, I have some questions & comments...\nFirstly, why should the DEFAULT keyword be needed? Seems to me that the mere presence of an equated value after the variable name will be sufficient, as in:\nreal function quadratic(x, a, b, c)\n! returns a + b * x + c * x2 if c is present and a + b * x otherwise\nreal, intent(in) :: x, a, b\nreal, intent(in), optional :: c = 0\nquadratic = a + b * x + c * x2\nend function quadratic\n\nAs far as I am aware, there is currently no way the language will allow an equated value for a variable declared as a dummy argument, so this seems sufficient to me. Also, providing a new keyword like DEFAULT might mislead folk into trying to put it on non-optional arguments and other (local variable) declarations. (If the intention is to distinguish this from the implicit save problem, then the name DEFAULT is not a good one, because it doesn't really mean \"do not save\". And I think we should keep this proposal well clear of any argument about implicit save.) Also also, when 2 or more arguments are declared in one statement, we would not wish to require them all to be given a default value, or none of them; this would be the implication of the presence of the DEFAULT keyword.\nSecond: do we allow the default value to change a simple variable into an array? Eg:\nSubroutine fred(a,b)\nreal, intent(in) :: a\nreal, intent(in), optional :: b = [1d0,2d0]\n\nNote that, absent the default, there is nothing in the declaration of B that makes it an array. IMO this should not be allowed, explicit shape information or the DIMENSION keyword should be required.\nThird: should the feature work for UDTs? Eg:\n\ntype t_stuff\nreal :: a = 22\nreal :: b = 33\nreal :: c = 44\nend type\nsubroutine uu(ff, st)\nreal, intent(in) :: ff\nreal, optional :: st = t_stuff(66,c=88)\n\n\nFourth: should it work on an OPTIONAL statement? eg:\nSubroutine fred(a,b)\nreal, intent(in) :: a, b\noptional :: b = [1d0,2d0]\n\nFifth: what about allocatables? eg:\nSubroutine fred(a,b)\nreal, intent(in) :: a\nreal, intent(in), allocatable, optional :: b(:) = [1d0,2d0]\n\nThis creates a default allocated array with 2 elements. I can't, however, see an obvious way to get an unallocated array as a default. Maybe it could be done by combining with the next one...\nSixth: should it allow initialization to a non-constant expression? eg:\nmodule jimmy\nreal :: ddd(100)\nend module\n! ...lots of lines of code later, after ddd has been set\nsubroutine billy(aaa,bbb)\nuse jimmy\nreal, intent(inout) :: aaa(20)\nreal, intent(inout), optional :: bbb(:) = ddd\n\n\n...That's probably more than enough for the moment."

However, this carries the risk that if #40 is shot down, then also this one can be refused, so maybe a better strategy to respond to this objection must be thought...\n\n\nShould not be allowed, as you suggest.\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nI don't fully understand what is the problem you're discussing here.

I tried to summarize it first, but not all the comments are necessarily consistent, so I simply present the comments:\n\nwhat if the optional argument has the TARGET attribute?\nconsider VOLATILE and ASYNCHRONOUS attributes of dummy arguments\nconcerns with the paper\n\nsyntax: doesn't like assignment form\nconsider other syntax using keywords e.g., DEFAULT (0)\nPRESENT should continue to work\n\n\nretain semantics in chain of\n\nINTENT IN, OUT same semantics?\npaper needs to be rewritten\n\n\nfeature with no applicability\n\nachieves little for the complexibility\nadds no new capability\nadding new ATTRIBUTE e.g., DEFAULT rather than OPTIONAL\n\n\nretain PRESENT semantics\n\nconditional expressions proposal offers option here with reducing code\nverbosity\n\n\nPRESENT semantics must be retained\n\nthis paper has a lot of appeal to coders\n\n\nconcerns with the paper\n\nassignment (=) syntax a non-starter, makes it more confusing\nPRESENT semantics if retained this paper will add little value\nHowever it's too risky to change PRESENT\nnested subroutines with OPTIONAL will become confusing e.g., 4 levels lose track of what is actually present\nThe proposal for Fortran 202X had also failed because impact on PRESENT semantics was unclear\n\n\npushes responsibility on the compiler to introduce the equivalent of\nlocal temp variable, can impact performance\nidea:\n\ncaller provides default\nagrees on the DEFAULT\n\n\ncomments:\n\nuse cases can be supported by VALUE attribute\nbut most other committee members disagreed stating VALUE semantics has other implications\nsuch as copy-in, copy-out\n\n\n\nTo summarize, the issue is that we do not want to change the behavior of present(). But then the issue is that it becomes really complicated if the user provides the value high in the call chain, then the nested subroutines might change how they behave, thus potentially creating performance bottlenecks.\nThe best way forward seems to be not to tie the default value with optional arguments. Rather, to introduce \u201cinitial\u201d (or \u201cdefault\u201d) attribute that can be applied to both local variables, as well as dummy variables. If applied to dummy variables, it would have no change in the subroutine itself --- the dummy argument would always be provided. However, at the call site, the compiler would put in the default value if the user does not provide it. That way there is no performance hit, and from the user perspective it achieves the same."

The standard's definition of \"automatic variable\" was needlessly narrowed to one that used a variable to specify a bound or length parameter. I no longer have records from that time; I sent them to the Computer History Museum. Loren Meissner is the curator for them.\nHad the AUTOMATIC attribute been retained, an obvious definition of AUTOMATIC with initialization would have meant automatic initialization, not SAVE. Specifying the AUTOMATIC attribute without initialization would simply confirm what we already say now. Explicitly specifying AUTOMATIC and SAVE for a particular variable should be prohibited. Explicitly specified AUTOMATIC would override default SAVE. AUTOMATIC would naturally be prohibited for storage-associated variables.\nOnce AUTOMATIC is defined that way, all that is necessary to provide default values for absent optional arguments is to define an absent OPTIONAL argument that has initialization to be a local automatic variable.\nThe PRESENT intrinsic should still be available to inquire whether there was an associated actual argument. Even if there's a value for a local variable acting in lieu of the absent dummy argument, it's still useful to know whether the actual argument was present."

But I don't recall why a notify_query subroutine was left out. Probably it had something to do with notify_type having a much more narrow use case than event_type, and all the uses we imagined for a notify_query ended up having better alternative approaches. Or it could have just been neglected.

If my understanding is correct, the \u2018put with notify\u2019 is very different from events. My focus is currently not on the question if a \u2018notify_query' could make sense, but to basically understand this \u2018put with notify\u2019 feature.\nFrom my current understanding, I would say (- in parentheses there are statements from the J3 papers that may match with my point of view -):\nhttps://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/18/18-277r1.txt\nhttps://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/19/19-259.txt\n\n\nDATA TRANSFER AND SYNCHRONIZATION ARE THE SAME SINGLE OPERATION:\nThe notify-specifier makes data transfer and it\u2019s synchronization to be semantically the same single operation.\n(\u201c...the notify can be incorporated into the same data packet as the value of y.\u201d)\n\n\nTHAT OPERATION HAS NO IMPACT ON SEGMENT ORDERING:\nInternally, this may not require use of SYNC MEMORY, thus the operation has no impact on segment ordering.\n(\u201c...the synchronization is only on this particular transfer, and not all outstanding memory operations on this image. The put with notify operation does not constitute segment ordering, ...\u201d)\n\n\nTO CONTROL THE EXECUTION FLOW OF A PARALLEL APP:\nFrom my own experiences with customized synchronizations: if we can synchronize and do data transfer within the same single operation, we can use that operation not only for efficient data transfer, but also to easily control the execution flow of a parallel app. This is important to implement distributed objects without the need for Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).\n(\u201c\u2026 the NOTIFY WAIT statement is not an image control statement.\u201d, \u201c...the NOTIFY WAIT execution control statement.\u201d)"

Although there are differences between event_type and notify_type, a common use case for both is to confirm that a communication has finished. In this case, the notify_type should be more efficient, which I understand is the main justification for adding it to the standard.\nOne situation where notify_query would be useful is if we receive data from more than one image. Below is a sketch of how this might be important in a fairly typical halo-exchange type situation. With only notify_wait, we'd get stuck when checking the first halo buffer (left in the program below) -- and thus lose the opportunity to check/unpack the right halo buffer immediately.\nprogram notify\n! Concept around notify_query -- important bits have comment \"KEY STEP\"\n!\n! Suppose we have a 'halo-exchange' type program\n! For simplicity consider a 1-dimensional PDE domain decomposition. \n!\n! With notify_query, we can check for data arrival from the left/right\n! neighbours, and unpack as soon as it arrives, without any enforced wait.\n!

The 'put with notify' feature could be an important addition for easy control of the execution flow with such distributed object programming.\nThe coarray model together with Fortran's OOP are already forming a new kind of programming language that may fit perfectly for upcoming EDGE.

It would also preserve the existing behavior for those who want it.\nPersonally I'd be happy to go as far as enforcing left-to-right short-circuiting in all logical expressions, which would adopt the behavior of other programming languages like C, C++, Python, Java, Lisp, Perl, JavaScript, Julia, R, Haskell, etc etc. My argument would be for more predictable codes and better programmer control. And, this wouldn't break existing programs because there currently isn't any standards-defined behavior for those programs to rely on (that I know of).\nOf course, as you mentioned this is controversial. Some Fortran programmers like that some compilers might rearrange their logical expressions and short-circuit in some optimal-ish order, though other compilers might evaluate the entire statement regardless. And, breaking troublesome if-statements into multiple lines as below is usually not very disruptive.

Which makes me think that an entire new construct with defined execution order must be introduced to not rewrite half of existing standard. I don't think it should be an operator like .and_then. because when it gets mixed with non short-circuting operators by skilled programmer scientists that will be hell.\nI suggest something along the lines of:\n! what we want to do\nif (present(x) .and. x > 10) x = 10\n! warning: requires changing the standard\nif (provided(present(x), x > 10)) x = 10\n! will crash or not?\nif (present(x).and.present(z).and_then.x>z+3) ...\nOther option is, since 95% of examples I see are with present and optional arguments, maybe just introduce default value for optional arguments and most complaints will vanish.

Would be the perfect complement to current square submatrix slices.\nSee also the Matlab's diag function and Python Numpy's diag function.\nUse cases:\n\nGetting the diagonal\n\nreal(dp) :: A(n, n)\nprint *, diag(A)\n\nSetting the diagonal\n\nreal(dp) :: A(n, n)\nA = 0\ndiag(A) = 1\nNote: The diag(A) = 1 syntax is new, as we are setting something to a result of a function.

An alternative notation that could be considered:\n\nGetting the diagonal\n\nreal(dp) :: A(n, n)\nprint *, A(\\)\n\nSetting the diagonal\n\nreal(dp) :: A(n, n)\nA = 0\nA(\\) = 1\nOr more generally A(start\\end\\skip) for the main diagonal and A(start/end/skip) for the anti-diagonal. In such case, an optional parameter could occur to denote which diagonal, as in Matlab, e.g., A(2\\4,0) gets 2nd thru 4th elements of the main diagonal, A(2\\4,1) gets 2nd thru 4th elements of diagonal above the main, etc.",

That's why I wrote \"an option to consider for certain use cases\"!\nWith so many aspects in Fortran (or for that matter, with other programming languages or paradigms), there simply are no \"perfect solutions\" for some coding needs.  A \"diag\" function might end up requiring expensive data copy operations and given how Fortran is structured, there can even be two sets of such operations, one to fetch the data from the matrix source in the first place followed then by another one during the assignment on the caller side!  So coders are left to pick the \"poison\" of their choice.\nIf better support for parameterized derived types (PDTs) toward Fortran 2003 and later revisions of the standard were available widely, coders wanting to work a lot with matrices and having to \"slice and dice\" the matrix \"data\" heavily might benefit from pursuing a coding design that uses a PDT as a 'class' for a matrix and having type-bound procedures (TBPs) to operate efficiently on the data.  For \"sliced and diced\" reference to matrix data, TBPs returning data pointers can prove really handy given the improvement introduced in the language starting with Fortran 2008 where pointers can be present in any variable-definition context including on the left-hand side of operations.\nReaders can note I point out different options due to the fact any changes in the Fortran language - say a DIAG(ONAL) utility, almost any simple trivial syntactic \"sugar\" for a coder to a semantic  improvement in language which improves coder productivity -  essentially take eons to take effect: first, an eon or more to influence and convince powers-that-be to even agree to add to the language standard, then a eon or more to work out the details, another X years for the standard containing that feature to go into \"official\" publication, followed by a decade or more for the facility to start appearing in enough compiler implementations so coders can confidently pursue the new facility in their code, but add another few years for the implementation bugs to be worked out for the facility to be robust from the most lax robustness and quality considerations for compilers (leave alone Six-sigma)!!!  Such considerations, unfortunately, need to be contemplated for all the \"wonderful\" ideas for Fortran that are going to pop up in this new GitHub issues respository!"

These are much more practical for library developers that wish to overload their procedures for the supported kinds of REAL provided by a given implementation.       In that case it is not that the developer wants a certain amount of precision.   They are trying to support other users that get to choose precision on their own.     REAL16 is proposed just simply to be consistent for an increasingly common option on some hardware.\nNote that REAL32 et al are not quite sufficient in and of themselves to allow a portable implementation that covers all supported real kinds.    Generally some logic is still required in the build system to control which kinds are selected.\nNote also that REAL32 is not necessarily the same thing as default REAL.  Theoretically it can be tricky to distinguish such things.  In practice, all extant compilers have kind(1.) == REAL32"

The remaining case of checking association status does not seem particularly useful to me. I suppose it could allow the pointer to be used in a way sort of like an optional value, with the procedure using its value if it is associated and otherwise using a default.

The usual case would presumably be to prevent a subroutine from altering the values of the target.\nThis could be either by something like\nreal, pointer, INTENT(IN), TINTENT(IN) :: x\nor\nreal, pointer, INTENT(IN,TARGETIN) :: x\nI'm increasingly in favor of an entirely different approach which would be more general.

Let's discuss it there.\n\nFortran has named constants which it attributes as PARAMETERs and which can go into the READONLY area of a program memory and be absolutely immutable from compile-time onward.  But then Fortran also has PROTECTED attribute  for which a module scope comes into play in terms of being definable/modifiable.  With pointers, the scope of the target cannot be limited to a particular module and it can very well be global.\nSo for a more general feature, perhaps Fortran can consider the notion of, say:\n  <some type>, POINTER, CONST_TARGET :: foo\nthat can apply to dummy arguments as well as variables?  And the semantics can be the same (or very similar) to \"constant pointers\" in C?\nAnd for generality, it will be convenient if named constants can take the TARGET attribute with the restriction only constant pointers can point to them.  There have been discussions on comp.lang.fortran where Fortran practitioners have expressed a strong interent in being able to point constant pointers to constant targets such as named constants."

People have been wanting this feature for years and it really is crippling to development. If this is pushed back until 202y then we likely won't see widespread compiler support until the 2030s.

I am a contributor to the FMS framework used by weather and climate models at GFDL (including my main job of MOM6 development), and it relies heavily on preprocessing of template-like code for many interface functions, such as for MPI operations.\nSome example code is below, where a file is #included multiple times, each time replacing MPP_TYPE_ and similar macros with different types, size, and rank (scalar, 2d, 3d, etc.):\n\n\nInterface definitions:\nhttps://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FMS/blob/2cd5dc6dc601c1238bbabdf1440b2057f957795b/mpp/mpp.F90#L680-L725\n\n\nRepeat #include statements of the above functions\nhttps://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FMS/blob/2cd5dc6dc601c1238bbabdf1440b2057f957795b/mpp/include/mpp_comm_mpi.inc#L1033-L1159\n\n\nThe low-level call to MPI:\nhttps://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FMS/blob/master/mpp/include/mpp_sum_mpi.h\n\n\nMid-level interface for different array ranks:\nhttps://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FMS/blob/master/mpp/include/mpp_sum.inc\n\n\nThis does work, and has worked for a long time, but it's a lot of bloat and gets even more complicated when trying to manage some of the conditional support for things like complex numbers and non-default kinds for integers or reals.\nI feel like this must be a common problem, and it would be great to find a template-like solution which can unify this sort of code."

Since then, this feature has been proposed several times but never accepted.\"\n\"I was expecting that these two features (at least, generic programming) were the main target of F202X (according to the last survey and some documents available online).\"\n\"my question is: What is the set of \"most compilers\" supposed in ..?\"  That is, in WG5 papers N2167 and N2168\n\"My concern is that some compilers seem very slow to catch up with new features. Initially, I imagined that this may be due to the difficulty of implementation. But more recently, I strongly feel that this is also due to the policy or direction of a company (e.g., investment). If the latter is a more major factor for one compiler, I am afraid that \"waiting for most compilers to catch up\" could mean \"forever\" in practice...\"\n\nThere is a lot to learn from the comments by practitioners of Fortran."

For concepts that are well-established in computer engineering widely such as generics and that are so well-known now and where every new language that crops up has sophisticated support for generics from the get-go or soon thereafter (e.g., Julia and Haskell), may be the approach should be the other way around?  Settle on syntax that conveys to the coders and processors of Fortran all they need and allow the semantics to simply fall out of that?\nSay the language introduces an attribute 'TYPE' with the existing statement of GENERIC: why can't the following convey for a processor everything it needs to setup generic interfaces for the 3 types shown in the original post here?\n  function f(x) result(r)\n     generic, type :: T => int, real, real(dp)\n     type(T), intent(in) :: x\n     type(T) :: r\n     x = x + 1 \n  end function\n\nIs committee overthinking this and needlessly procrastinating the development of generics in Fortran?"

                    "text": "Just to add another proposal to the mix...\nAs I've reflected upon previously, one of the issues with templates in Fortran is how the type system really consists of four different aspects:\n\nType (e.g., real, integer, a derived type, etc.)\nKind (how values are stored in memory)\nRank (the number of dimensions of an array)\nSize/length (the number of elements in each dimension of an array, or the number of characters in a string)\n\nIn most programming languages these would all be grouped together to define a single type, but in Fortran they are semi-independent.  What's more, there are different approaches for what needs to be known at compile-time and what can be deferred to run-time. At one extreme is kind, which must be known at compile-time (even for parameterised derived types), and at the other is size/length, which can be deferred to run-time via allocatable and assumed-shape variables.\nIn C++ a single brief string can specify all of this information (e.g., double[10][20]), making it easy to template over all of it at once. In Fortran this would be more difficult. Currently, parameterised derived types (PDTs) attempt to provide some features along these lines for kind and size. While I haven't personally made use of them, its approach to parameterising size actually looks pretty good. However, parameterising kind is not very useful because all kinds must be known at compile-time. This means that we can't defer the kind until run-time, even for dummy arguments of procedures. It is this last bit which is really crippling, because it means that the user must write separate implementations of a procedure for each kind parameter value, making PDTs essentially worthless.\nIt would be nice if a new templating system could both fix this shortcoming and build on the current PDT syntax. I think there could be a relatively straightforward way to achieve the first of these: the introduction of parameterised procedures. The syntax could be something like the following:\nsubroutine example(a, b, c) parameters(k, l)\n  integer, kind :: k\n  integer, len :: l\n  real(k), dimension(l), intent(in) :: a, b\n  real(k), dimension(2*l), intent(out) :: c\n  \n  c(1:l) = a\n  c(l+1:2*l) = b\nend subroutine example\nType-bound procedures, finalisers, and abstract interfaces can also be made parameterised, allowing PDTs to be used in object-oriented manner. Unlike with PDTs, where the kinds get specified by the user when declaring a variable (or revert to a default value), for parameterised procedures the compiler would be required to determine the parameter values from the arguments which are passed in. If they are invalid (e.g, if the above subroutine were called with inconsistent kinds) then it should produce a compile-time error or (for len parameters, where this may not be possible) a run-time error.\nIt would then just be a matter of defining two additional sorts of type/procedure parameters, corresponding to type and rank. The exact syntax of this is a matter for further discussion, especially with regards to rank where I can't see an obvious approach. For types it could look something like this:\nsubroutine example(a, b, c) parameters(t, k, l)\n  typespec :: t\n  integer, kind :: k\n  integer, len :: l\n  t(k), dimension(l), intent(in) :: a, b\n  t(k), dimension(2*l), intent(out) :: c\n  \n  c(1:l) = a\n  c(l+1:2*l) = b\nend subroutine example\nIt might be possible to restrict the type-spec somewhat by allowing some sort of \"concepts\" or \"typeclasses\" to be defined in advance, as suggested by @arjenmarkus in #29."

I felt this strongly when I read the discussions and responses about generics on comp.lang.fortran (much ago). There, the committee wanted to know the use cases of generics (apart from swap()), and it seems that only statistics (from the user survey) became the reason for considering generics as a candidate for revision. So I have some concern that the same thing might happen for other proposals (i.e., they do not \"feel\" good or bad about a new proposal and so possibly not willing to give either positive or negative responses).\nBut my concern above may be too nervous...

For example, some people insist using \"std::\" in C++ always, but I often import specific entities locally for brevity (unless ambiguity occurs). Here, the choice also depends on coding styles, approaches, and even on each specific program, I think.\nRE DRY, I am also not very sure whether this word is really appropriate here for one explanation (because the word seems to originate from other fields).

See below.\n\nTo me it's rather the other way: the moment that fortraners who are already used to renaming variables see they can also rename modules they will try to do both at the same time, and they won't understand why they cannot do this.\n\nThere are two kinds of imports: one imports symbols from a module. We can do that already:\n\n\n\nPython\nFortran\n\n\n\n\nfrom A import x\nuse A, only: x\n\n\nfrom A import x as y\nuse A, only: y => x\n\n\nfrom A import *\nuse A\n\n\n\nOne can either import all symbols, or just some. And one can also rename symbols on import. I think there is no disagreement here. However, notice that neither Python nor Fortran allows you to import a derived type x and somehow rename its members. That fundamentally does not make sense. You can access the member a as x%a, or if you rename x at import time using y%a. But you cannot rename a to b. If you want to do that, you have to assign it as a variable:\ninteger :: b\nb = x%a\nThe other kind of import is to import the whole module as a namespace:\n\n\n\nPython\nFortran\n\n\n\n\nimport A\nuse, namespace :: A\n\n\nimport A as B\nuse, namespace :: B => A\n\n\n\nOne can import it, and optionally rename it. You can view the module A as a derived type. Just like in the previous case it does not make sense to rename members of the derived type, it does not make sense to rename members of the module A if you are accessing them via A%x. If you want to use a different name, you have to do it using a variable, as in the previous case:\ntype(x_t) :: y\ny = A%x\nOr you can use associate.\nRegarding using Python as an argument --- Python is just an example (but a good one!). Do you know of any language that would allow you to do what you are asking for? Also, do you have any use cases for it?\nThe use cases for my proposal above are many, e.g., fortran-lang/stdlib#49, fortran-lang/stdlib#99 as well as all the precedents in other languages. I think even you agree with my limited proposal based on your comments above. We are just catching up with other languages and we are not designing something new and untested.\nThe feature use, namespace :: sm => some_module, only: t1 => thing1 on the other hand does not seem to have precedent in another language and it does not seem to be consistent with Fortran either, per my comment above. As such, that should give us a pause and we should step back and ask if it makes sense what we are designing. If you or others can motivate very well how this make sense and use cases, etc., and can convince the community that we should have it, I am not going to be blocking it. All I am saying is that this seems new and untested and seems inconsistent, so we better be sure we want that."

I briefly described the feature in 2 minutes and we discussed for about 15 minutes. Here is the feedback from various members of the committee (thus not necessarily consistent):\n\n\n\ncomment on SIN function: use GENERIC facility in current standard (can't you just make conflicting functions generic and rename on use?)\nNo big difference between module%foo and module_foo\nthis idea is not very compelling\ndo not like '%'; use ':' instead (do not like '.') possibly. Some compilers use colon in error messages and wouldn't use percent to indicate a name inside a module.\nbut colon probably can't be used either. backtick? apostrophe? Period won't work because use might not be private, and we might want nested modules in the future.\nprefers rename on use over namespacing anyways, even if it is there.\n\n\n\nthis is great, fortran doesn't have great mechanisms for this.\n\n\n\nuse Haskell language a lot which has this feature and it is useful\nthis idea should work for derived types and other entities also?\nmight be better as a \"seller\" of this idea to use entities other than procedures in use cases (derived type might be a better use case for this)\n\n\n\n\nWhile working with Modula: did something similar\nbut the main attraction of this idea is for compiler to track where an entity comes from\n\n\n\n\nnot very compelling; renaming facility in current Fortran is ok\nsomething like this might be more relevant in Python world where packages come from disparate places\nstylistically nice, preferable if we have it, but hard to come up with a compelling use case. This is useful in python where there's lots of packages which might conflict, might be useful more as time goes on--we may have a future with packages & libraries. you can almost do everything now if you twist things to work, but it's not as convenient.\n\n\n\n\nthis looks like a solution in search of a problem\n\n\n\n\nin relation to nesting of module entities, will direct qualification be possible? if you allow nesting there may be more than one unique way to get to the object you want.\n\n\n\nthis promotes collaboration, and we have a hidden need for this. the language needs to evolve to facilitate collaboration.\n\n\nIt seems the main conclusion is to provide better use cases (with derived types, and other things) and to address the above objections in the proposal and resubmit next time."

Note the token BIND\n in my simple-minded thinking can be viewed as a verb or a command or an\n instruction which is what seems to be the need here.\n\n So thinking along the same lines, an alternate suggestion will be to use\n DECORATE as the token:\n\n use, decorate :: utils\n ..call utilsXsavetxt(..)\n\n where X is the separator yet to be decided; it can be % (as in call\n utils%savetxt(..)) or it might be double-colon (as in call\n utils::savetxt(..)), etc.\n\n And additional options with (re)naming can be introduced as\n\n use, decorate( name=\"ut\" ) :: utils\n ..call utXsavetxt(..)\n\n With the STATEMENT form, the expected syntax is\n\n use utils\n ..\n decorate :: utils\n ..call utilsXsavetxt(..)\n\n Applying the same to @smeskos <https://github.com/smeskos> 's examples\n above, I would expect the syntax to be\n\n use, decorate(name=\"math\") :: mathematics, only : cdif => central_differencecall mathXcdif()\n\n And if the optional name is not employed,\n\n use, decorate :: mathematics, only : cdif => central_differencecall mathematicsXcdif()\n\n With the example in the J3 paper (\n https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/19/19-246.txt), the syntax can look like\n so:\n\n     use, decorate :: math\n     use, decorate(name=\"np\") :: numpy\n     use, decorate( name=\"sym\") :: sympy\n     ...\n     e1 = npXsin(npXpi)      ! NumPy expression\n     e2 = mathXsin(mathXpi)  ! Built-in Python math expression\n     e3 = symXsin(symXpi)    ! SymPy expression\n\n and\n\n     use, decorate :: lapack\n     ..\n     call lapackXdgeev('N', 'V', n, At, lda, wr, wi, vl, ldvl, vr, ldvr, &\n      work, lwork, info)\n     ..\n     call lapackXdgetrf(n, n, Amt, lda, ipiv, info)\n     ..\n\n \u2014\n You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n <#1 (comment)>,\n or unsubscribe\n <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AC4NA3O3N7FNNZ3GMNFHHO3SHYQMNANCNFSM4JBFRGNA>\n ."

As there has been a significant pause in postings on this issue, I think it is an appropriate to summarize our current syntactic options to prompt more suggestions for options. There are four orthogonal choices in the syntax:\n\nWhat word to use as the keyword\nWhere to put the keyword\nHow to do module renaming\nWhat to use as the accessor \"operator\"\n\nWhat word to use\nSo far I have seen the following suggestions for keywords:\n\nadorn - a shorter version of decorate\nas or as is - one for renaming the other for non-renaming. What happens if you want to rename to is?\ndecorate - slightly long, has a dirfferent meaning in software engineering\nemploy - a synonym to use\nimport - used for this in Python, but already a keyword with different semantics\nnamespace - main problem is its length, but users of C++, where namespace behaves like Fortran's use, may find this usage counterintuitive\nns - an abbreviation for namespace that is similar to nanosecond\nonly - only as a use statement terminator, overloads its current meaning\nqualified - one of its meanings is suggestive of the semantics, but not the most commonly used meaning, as long as namespace\nsource - slightly suggestive of the semantics\nusing - similar to use, slightly suggests requiring the module name to access\nwith - main advantage is its length, some find it unintuitive\n\nAre there any names I missed? With this many options it might be best to do a ranked choice vote.\nWhere to put the keyword\nI know of three possible places to put the keyword\n\nAt the beginning, making its own statement, i.e, keyword[[, module-nature]::] .... This is what most of the languages cited do.\nAfter the use keyword: use [[, keyword][, module-nature]::] ... or use [[, module-nature][, keyword]::] .... It will be tempting to lump the keyword with intrinsic and nonintrinsic in module-nature, in which case the standard needs to explain that there is no only or rename list.\nReplacing the only keyword: use[[, module-nature]::] module-name, keyword[:local-module-name]\nmaking a third form of a use statement.\n\nHow to rename modules\nI have noted three ways to do module renaming:\n\nUse a syntax based on the rename list of the use statement [local-module-name=>]module-name, e.g.,\n\n\nkeyword[[, module-nature]::] [local-module-name=>]module-name\nuse [[, keyword][, module-nature]::] [local-module-name=>]module-name\nuse [[,module-nature]::][local-module-name=>]module-name, keyword\n\n\nAfter the colon after the module name where the keyword replaces only: use [[,module-nature]::]module-name, keyword[: local-module-name]\nIn a parenthesized rename after the keyword\n\n\nkeyword[([name=]local-module-name)][[, module-nature]::] module-name\nuse [[, keyword[([name=]local-module-name)]][, module-nature]::] module-name\nuse [[,module-nature]::]module-name, keyword[([name=]local-module-name)]\n\nWhat to use as accessor operator\nI have noted two suggestions for the accessor operator\n\n%, used as the accessor for derived types\n::, used extensively in the specification-part, but not in the execution-part of Fortran programs/subprograms. The main question is would its use cause what is intended to be an executable statement, to be interpreted as a specification statement, i.e., could a module name be the same as the start of a specification statement.\n\nIn principle other characters could also be used: backtick, ~, @, ^, |, and \\ are ASCII characters not used by Fortran, and, I believe, not used by the common pre-processors.\nFWIW I tend to prefer the shorter keywords, but dislike overloading the meaning of \"only\" and \"import\". So my first preference is with followed by using and adorn. I believe modifying the use statement to incorporate the keyword, will more complicate the standard than having a keyword statement, so I prefer a keyword statement. Because I don't want a modified use statement, I don't want the rename after the colon after the keyword. I don't have strong feelings about keyword[([name=]local-module-name)] versus [local-module-name=>]module-name. I prefer the accessor to be the same as for derived types, i.e., %, but :: would also be acceptable.\nEdit: Formatting by @milancurcic for readability"

At the very least, I think people with sufficient knowledge of compiler development or CS backgrounds should be more responsible for this kind of tasks. In this regard, I always wonder: what is the role of the  current international standard committee here? Are they not consisting of compiler or CS experts to participate in proposing new features (if they belong to large companies and involved in Fortran related products)? I hope the compiler or CS experts in the committee (if any) will play more active roles in proposing new features to catch up with other modern languages (and make the life easier for Fortran users).\n\nAnd some cases are not obvious.  (...snip...)\n\nRE MODULE PROCEDURE NS%FOO, EXTERNAL :: NS%FOO, VOLATILE NS%FOO (<-- I understand that the \"response\" (particularly from noobs like me) is not needed here, but anyway...), I feel that the first stage for introducing such namespace can be very restrictive, for example, something like \"one shall not add new attributes for module entities defined in one scope via qualification by other modules\" etc, etc (so as to minimize the workload of considering semantic implications). And if it turns out to be no problem to allow a particular usage later, I guess the latter may be added (\"relaxed\") later (which seems to be a typical pattern used in Fortran before)."

However, Chapel is still a very niche language (it is even not within 100th of the TIOBE ranking), and I think it is no wonder that it is not known very well. (And, I am not trying to \"sell\" Chapel in any way; it has its own limitations that are different from Fortran or other languages.)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_(programming_language)\nRE Python and Julia, they are already pretty popular in all the language list, but they are dynamically typed languages, so I think there exist inherent differences from statically typed languages (IMO). For example, in Python, module names and other variables are treated on an equal footing, but I guess it is not \"equal\" in statically typed languages. So, although the comparison with popular languages is useful (in that they increase the degree of familiarity for potential users from other languages), I am afraid there is potential cases that can lead to issues. After all, I also think that experimental implementation would reveal potential issues (based on specifications by experts, if possible...)"

Other languages I've been learning all use the concept of modules + import now (indeed, things seem to have been converging to the latter). I think the concept of namespaces is of more \"low-level\" and possibly plays more primitive roles as building blocks. However, given that Fortran already has modules, what is the merit of further introducing the concept of namespaces separately?

The committee and the community is composed of both users and compiler vendors / experts, and we need both to collaborate on new features.
