But I may be mistaken. I would say that describing the last three points in depth would suffice for most if not all Fortran projects, but you can easily prove me wrong.

But I don't think that letting fpm generate a Makefile removes the need of an introduction to make. An fpm generated Makefile would be on the same level as an autotools or CMake generated one and not supposed to be read or modified by the user (at least in my opinion). Also, I would prefer to discuss fpm related features at the fpm repository instead."

To keep it simple, I\nwill describe what I understand regarding the GCC compiler suite:\nmingw64.exe: a program compiled with the GCC compilers understands the\nWindows-style path names, the home directory I get with \"echo $HOME\" is\n\"/home/markus\", but if I ask in a C program for the current directory if I\nam in my home directory, I get \"c:\\msys64-2020\\home\\markus\\\".\nI can copy the program to another machine or run it in a plain command\nwindow without any problem.\n\nmsys2.exe: if I do the same under this shell, I have a different version of\nthe compiler and the run-time libraries. The result of getcwd() would then\nbe Unixy - \"/home/markus\".

A package without license is unusable by definition (for open source projects), which is unfair to packages with permissive licensing conditions.\nFor a simple summary see: https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/\nI went through all the packages with license: none and tried to identify the licenses. I also tried to correct all licenses which are not valid SPDX license identifiers. Many missing licenses were malformatted BSD or MIT licenses, but some had actually interesting licensing condition like original MIT license with changes under BSD-3-Clause and so on.\nThere are still some issues with the GPL-2.0, and GPL-3.0, which should have the -only or -or-later suffix. (L)GPL-2 and (L)GPL-3 is usually insufficient to identify the license of a package clearly, since the minor version is missing.\nThis PR is open for discussion.",

Its existence begins when execution of the function is initiated and ends when execution of the\nfunction is terminated.

Also, take a look at Steve Kargl's post in our discourse here. Finally, another similar discussion can be found here.\nRegarding Question2:\nI personally follow the way presented by @milancurcic :\n\nI do exactly the same thing as your examples of function accepting and subroutine returning strings. I imagine this is common use.\nQuestion 1: You're doing nothing wrong. Gfortran is warning about correct Fortran.\nQuestion 2:\nmodule mod_str\ncontains\n  pure function str()\n    character(:), allocatable :: str\n    str = 'hello'\n  end function str\nend module mod_str\n\n\nprogram test_str\n  use mod_str, only: str\n  print *, str()\nend program test_str\n\nHowever, since we are into this discussion, I also have something to add about the behavior of allocatable characters that may be relevant.\nThe following compiles with no warnings or errors but abords at runtime with a segmentation error:\ncharacter(len=:),allocatable :: str\n\nsubroutine init_string(filename, str)\n    character(len=*),intent(in) :: filename\n    character(len=:),allocatable, intent(out) :: str\n    open(file...)\n    read(unit,*)str\n    close(file...)\nend subroutine init_string\nwhile this is correct:\ncharacter(len=:),allocatable :: str\n\nsubroutine init_string(filename, str)\n    character(len=*),intent(in) :: filename\n    character(len=:),allocatable, intent(out) :: str\n    character(len=50) :: temp ! 50 is just a random number for demonstration purposes\n    open(file...)\n    read(unit,*)temp\n    str = trim(temp)\n    close(file...)\nend subroutine init_string\nAnother interesting behavior is when the allocatable character in the above example is part of a derived type eg:\ntype  t_gas\n    character(len=:),allocatable :: name\n    double :: mass\n    etc...\nend type t_gas\nNow assume we defined a type(t_gas)::gas and tried to read gas%name as we did in the first nonworking example then the program runs without any error but in reality name%gas remains uninitialized, you can print it and it just returns blank but NO error!!"

Our development is done in a (non-openly visible) gitlab server at the University of Siegen, whose reviewed merge requests are mirrored to our public gitlab server in Siegen and an svn repository at Hepforge. Distribution tarballs are also available via http://launchpad.net/whizard. We are using both OpenMP and MPI for parallelized Monte Carlo integration and simulation, in our development version using also non-blocking communication. Two of our team members, Wolfgang Kilian and J\u00fcrgen Reuter, are relatively active on c.l.f., the Intel forum, and the gfortran bugzilla.",

But it is then misleading to users when they think that Fortran is not that fast.\nTo fix that, we have to maintain our own benchmarks, and test them with several Fortran compilers, and ensure that all optimization options are enabled. And we should benchmark against other languages.\nThis will also provide motivation for Fortran compiler vendors to speed up some of these benchmarks if Fortran is not the fastest.\nHere are some ideas for benchmarks to include:\n\nhttps://julialang.org/benchmarks/\nhttps://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/fortran.html\nhttps://github.com/ParRes/Kernels\n...",

For C++, we should include an equivalent code, we specifically should not allow to include assembly instrinsics like this one: https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/program/nbody-gpp-7.html, full of assembly intrinsics. More specifically, we should mention it that you can of course write this in assembly (or inline it in C++ in various ways), but in our main benchmarks, we should put code that people would actually write to solve the problem in the given language itself without resolving to assembly. The same with the Rust version that currently is the fastest: https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/program/nbody-rust-7.html, it's full of assembly intrinsics.\nThen we can have a section where anything is allowed, including assembly.\nThe idea is that with enough expertise, the best is to optimize in assembly. For example OpenBLAS is mostly in assembly. But the point of the benchmarks is to see how fast can you get if you only stick to the language and canonical ways of doing things in the language.\nTo put it another way: our benchmarks should show, that Fortran is an excellent choice for this mission:\n\nenable scientists, engineers, and other domain experts to write programs that naturally express the mathematics and algorithms employed, are portable across HPC systems, remain viable over decades of use, and extract a high percentage of performance from the underlying hardware."

            "text": "We discussed website tutorials on our June 19 call and we tentatively agreed to organize the mini-books that teach the language itself around topics, rather than skill level. Each mini-book would then cover the topic with increasing skill level, starting from the most basic concepts and building toward more advanced.\nThis is specific to the mini-books that teach the language itself. We'd still have other mini-books that cover other topics like building programs, best practices, Rosetta code and similar.\nOn the call a few people suggested that we discuss what should be the topics to cover. I think we should aim to define topics that are mostly complementary, have little overlap between each other (but it's impossible to completely avoid overlap). Here are the topics that I think would work well:\n\nBuilt-in types and operators\nControl flow\nProcedures\nModules\nArrays\nStrings\nDerived types\nI/O\nOOP\nParallel programming\nC-interop\n\nAs an example of building skill level within a topic, mini-book on parallel programming would cover all parallel concepts, from basic to advanced: Images, synchronization, coarrays, collectives, teams, events, and perhaps even some example parallel algorithms.\nIn this approach, a user of any skill level who wants to learn or refresh memory on any aspect of the language, knows where to look for it because the mini-books are organized by topic. Once in the mini-book, they can skip forward to more advanced aspects of a topic if needed.\nHow this all evolves exactly in practice, I don't know. Perhaps @LKedward will have some ideas. Perhaps we just expand the sections in the existing Quickstart until they become complete enough to warrant transitioning them into a dedicated mini-book.\nWhat do you think?",

I like your topic breakdown - this gives us a good starting point!\nWhere there is overlap between topics, will we be referring the reader to the corresponding mini-book (as a recommended prerequisite) or will we be repeating the content in both mini-books? The obvious examples I can think of are Procedures/Interfaces being prerequisite for Modules/C-interop and Derived types being prerequisite to OOP.\nThe problem with repeated content is increased maintainer workload and potential confusion for readers as to where best to go for a topic. The former problem can probably be solved by sharing pages between mini-books in the yaml file but I feel this exacerbates the latter issue of confusing readers.\nIMO, I think for these situations it is best not to repeat content and to recommend pre-requisite mini-books in the introduction of the dependent mini-book. The disadvantage of this approach is that the mini-books are not perfectly self-contained but partially interdependent.\nThere is a question about the future of the Quickstart mini-book - I would prefer to keep the mini-book as a brief overview of the main language features but with links to the other mini-books for each topic in detail. The Quickstart mini-book would not be part of the core language mini-books but the 'Other' mini-books.\nFinally, your proposed Parallel Programming book is a Coarray Parallel Programming book - I want to ask whether we are going to additionally cover MPI, OpenMP, and OpenACC as well. IMO we should include these, each in a separate mini-book, because they are well-established standards and I don't see any reason to arbitrarily limit the tutorial content to just the Fortran standard."

Recently I was at an OpenMP training course where I discovered they have a lot of nice training material also for Fortran. The book by Dragos B. Chirila also contains an OpenMP chapter in the context of Fortran.\nAn overview of solutions for GPU programming including CUDA, OpenCL, OpenMP, and OpenACC from the Fortran perspective would also be nice. I understand however, that the goal of coarrays was exactly to remove the burden of having to learn all of these standards and focus instead on the actual problem. There is a recent paper where they attempted to use coarrays on GPUs.\nWe could also ask the developers of these standards if they are willing to contribute a mini-book."

The obvious examples I can think of are Procedures/Interfaces being prerequisite for Modules/C-interop and Derived types being prerequisite to OOP.\n\nI also think referring the reader to other mini-books, rather than repetition, is better. One technique I learned from Manning is that if a mini-book (chapter) strongly depends on another, for example the way OOP depends on derived types, then at the beginning of the mini-book we can state clearly:\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you have a good grasp of the derived types. If you don't, please work through the derived types mini-book first.\n\nor similar. Another technique is to add a reference to a definition whenever we first bring up a term that we won't define here. For example, in OOP, when we first show a listing with a derived type in it, we can say something like:\n\nThis is a derived type, which is described in <link to derived type mini-book>.\n\n\nFinally, your proposed Parallel Programming book is a Coarray Parallel Programming book - I want to ask whether we are going to additionally cover MPI, OpenMP, and OpenACC as well.

Because you don't have permissions to write to the file directly, GitHub will automatically create a fork for you, but you don't have to worry about doing anything with it.\nOnce you made the changes, somewhere at the bottom there will be a prompt to open a pull request. This is the part I'm less clear about how it looks exactly because I did this myself only a few times. But the UI should be able to guide you.\n\nLet me know how it goes or if anything's unclear. I recently guided Arjen in #77 to do the same. It seems that it would be useful that we have these notes somewhere prominent on the website, as these steps apply to all projects."

I understand if the current setup is irritating, that people are unhappy. If we switch, it will be irritating to some others.

My thinking is that this Quickstart tutorial is meant for people who already know how to program, they are most probably experienced programmers in another language and want a quick \"get up to speed\" with modern Fortran.  In that sense everyone, more or less is accustomed with OOP features, and would expect to learn how to implement the basic OOP features in Fortran syntax."

Being experienced with OOP is quite advanced.\nBut it's not even the OOP, but more that it lists a set of rules and syntaxes in standardese-like format, without concrete examples. It reads more like reference than learning material."

The only Jekyll issue that I see is actually nothing about Jekyll but with gem and bundler, which IMO just plain suck. Especially when you start using specific versions. Tracebacks are inscrutable.\nHugo was actually what I started working with at first and then gave up after few hours. I was somewhat familiar with Jekyll already, and Hugo is overall more complex so there was more to learn.\nSo setting up the tooling to run Jekyll is worse than Hugo. But after you do that once, I think Jekyll is easier to work with than Hugo. Personal opinion of course.\nBuild previews that @LKedward made mostly solves this. If you know how to submit a PR, there's no need to run locally. For writing markdown pages and submitting content this is good enough. If you need to make structural changes to the website, chances are that setting up Jekyll is not an issue."

Do you have any thoughts on what could go in this? Perhaps we should open an issue to discuss that.\n\n@LKedward I think you refer to this. I apologize that I didn't provide feedback back in that thread. I didn't in part because I haven't gotten clear my self with the best way forward, and this in a difficult problem to solve.\nI like the approach of mini-books over one large monolithic book. However, we're currently unclear what the specific mini-books are and what separates them. When you separate a subject matter into multiple parts (mini-books) you need to decide how to separate them. You can do it in different ways:\n\nBy topic (compiling and linking, arrays, control flow, OOP, etc.)\nBy reader skill level (intro, advanced, expert)\nBy teaching method (tutorial, reference, cookbook, FAQ, best practices)\n\nDifferent teaching methods serve different purposes, so I think we all agree we need separation by teaching method (e.g. we'll have best practices from fortran90.org etc.). There are kind of a neutral ground mini-books, because they will tend to touch on all of the topics, and be useful to programmers of all skill levels.\nHowever, please, please be cautious of separating mini-books by both topic and skill level at the same time. By doing that you have to assume which topics are basic or advanced. And by assuming that you're assuming about what the reader needs. Which I don't think we can or should assume.\nAnother problem is overlap in content. Inevitably, both the intro and advanced mini-books will cover I/O, arrays, derived types etc. There will be a lot of repetition and cross-referencing. An average reader won't know ahead of time where the specific feature they're looking for is described.\nI urge everybody here to discuss and decide whether to separate by topic or by skill level, but please don't do both. We'll end up with many messy and complicated books.\nMy preference is to separate by topic (e.g. mini-book on arrays, I/O, OOP, parallelism, interop etc.), and each successive section of a mini-book builds gradually in depth and skill level. Of course, some topics will depend on others, and we'll end up with a natural sequence of mini-books that form a nice, coherent, large book, just like the Rust book. Which is what we wanted in the first place. :)"

Based off this previous conversation, this is also my preferred method of separation.\n@milancurcic, my mention of an \"Intermediate Fortran\" book may have caused confusion - by this I meant that it would be good to have a follow-on book from the Quickstart tutorial that covers more advanced topics that are not already contained within the Quickstart tutorial. i.e. they are split by topic where multiple topics are grouped within a book. This would be more of a \"Further Fortran\" book.\nI realise that it may be preferable to have more topic granularity at the book level (one topic per book), however I also don't think we should have ~10 books each consisting of ~3 paragraphs to start off with.\n\nthis in a difficult problem to solve.\n\nAbsolutely, the idea behind the mini-books is to give us as much flexibility in structuring the content while also enabling us to publish content incrementally instead of in large tranches.\nMy idea was that topics can start off as sections and be expanded to pages and then broken-out into stand-alone books, as more content is added."

Regarding the header, you only need to change the title field to the title of your tutorial\nand the permalink field to something like permalink: /learn/building_programs - this will cause the web address of your tutorial to be https://fortran-lang.org/learn/building_programs. The ending after /learn/ just needs to be a short descriptive string for your tutorial. The other fields (layout, navbar) can be kept the same as in the index file.\nI'm not sure if we are using a different license for the tutorial content - the website source is currently licensed under MIT, but it may be a good idea to license the tutorials under one of the CC-BY licenses. As the author and copyright holder, the licensing of the tutorial content is ultimately your choice - but it would be good to agree a license for all tutorial and similar content on fortran-lang.org.

But I trust @certik and if he says that OpenBLAS has a meaningful and useful Fortran binding, I'm okay with it.\nI want to also caution about the \"Interfaces\" category. If you looked at our existing categories, you'll see that \"Interfaces\" is the only category that says \"how something works\" rather than \"what it does\".\nSimilar to @LKedward, for me by far the main purpose of this page is for new developers to be able to find the tool they need for their Fortran work. Not so much for us to prove there are pure Fortran packages out there, or to be proud of it. That too is important, but is secondary to me.\nIn that sense, when a newcomer to Fortran arrives to the packages page, the \"Interfaces\" category is the only one that doesn't really tell them what's in there, only that the packages in there are bindings to other languages. However, I don't think this category is necessarily harmful, and is okay to keep it."

It's a great library.\nYes, LAPACK predates iso_c_binding, and OpenBLAS just follows what LAPACK does. The tradition there is to just provide the symbols and hope that they work (but they do in practice, even if I don't recommend to do that for new projects).\nSo let's put it into into interfaces.\nI think we are in agreement --- for you and @LKedward the main purpose is to list packages that are useful for Fortran developers to use. For me that is part of it. But equally important for me is to leverage our community and connect us to each other and to show what is out there, and showing how Fortran can be used --- because I think we absolutely have to prove that Fortran can be used for new projects and for new developments.

As discussed, the interface is not iso_c_binding interface, but it's the old fashioned LAPACK interface. However it works.\nSo I am going to close this PR, I think OpenBLAS can stay where it is.

Many repos could fall in that are either unusable or semi-usable, or they're a slight modification of another project.\nAs you say, we need to decide what makes a package relevant enough. I think some requirements should be:\n\nPure Fortran or mixed-language project where Fortran is the majority of the code (or > than some % of the code). This is somewhat arbitrary;\nEither installable by fpm (in the future) or includes install instructions in the repo;\nUnique: We shouldn't include packages that are a slight modification of an existing package.

I expected that it meant \"Explore Fortran language\" which would be more like a tutorial. Should we use a more specific word here, perhaps \"Packages\"?\nFortran-lang organisation projects: I'd like to de-empasize \"organization\" and emphasize community. I suggest rewording this header as \"Fortran-lang community projects\", and adding this website and repo as the 3rd project. I'd like us to encourage people to discover this website as an editable and contributable project in motion, rather than a static place on the internet.\nFeatured community projects: Considering point above, then we should reword this to avoid confusion with this specific community (fortran-lang.org) and because not all projects listed are community projects. Perhaps a broader header, Featured open source projects is more appropriate.\n\nCategory sub-pages: I recommend not navigating to a level 3 sub-page for each category, but to have one longer page (level 2) that lists all categories and projects, with a hyperlinked category TOC at the top. Then the visitor could easily browse all categories and packages without navigating away. I personally start to get lost when websites have level 3 sub-page.\nSpecific categories: I don't think these categories work well. Specifically, they're all broad and have overlap between each other. I suggest having more specific and narrowly defined categories, like Linear Algebra, Simulation, Graphics, General purpose, and perhaps others.\n\n\n\nThe rewording suggestions are probably easy to implement here. If you agree, you can include them as part of this PR.\nFor others I suggest we open specific follow-up PRs to improve each part of the page."

Specifically, they're all broad and have overlap between each other. I suggest having more specific and narrowly defined categories, like Linear Algebra, Simulation, Graphics, General purpose, and perhaps others.\n\n\nYep this is true - as I've added more packages, it's become clearer which categories to use and they are now more distinct. The category system is very extensible, so future PRs can refine easily.\n\nThis is great, thank you so much @LKedward !\nWe need to ensure all the codes from https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/wiki/List-of-popular-open-source-Fortran-projects are there.\n\nThanks @certik, I've been through that whole list now; for this initial PR I've prioritised adding libraries and modules that would be of use to Fortran programmers over large domain-specific scientific applications. Having been through the list (and as you note also) I find that the number of stars is actually a poor indicator of package utility IMHO. I find they are much more like social media 'likes' - we see this in the skew towards large scientific applications, which are domain-specific and hence of limited utility to the wider Fortran community.

And you can use an email.\nI wondered for LFortran a lot, whether we need a mailinglist or not, initially we just setup Zulip. But later we created a mailinglist, so that I can post my updates there, and we can have a general discussion from time to time if needed.\nFor example: we should have a medium where we can announce the FortranCon, and other things and have means for people to discuss it.

The chat is less permanent, but the Discourse might be a good option. Discourse is probably the closest to a mailinglist.\nThe kind of discussions that people would have are visible e.g. here:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.lang.fortran\nYou can see that anyone can post an announcement of a new project or a new idea or a new conference, and then people can discuss and comment.

There is GitHub Help documentation, but to be honest I don't think it will be helpful. Instead, I recommend just exploring and trying to find your way through practice. It looks quite busy at first but you get used to it.\nIf you'd like, I'm happy to get on a Zoom video call with you to guide you via shared screen. Just let me know.\nOtherwise, the best place for you to start is the J3 Fortran proposals repo:\nhttps://github.com/j3-fortran/fortran_proposals/issues\nYou will find many discussion topics there, a few of them evolved into J3 papers. I suggest to read those, and post in whichever you want.\n\nBut your point also makes me think of this: We should probably have a dedicated \"Contributor's guide\" page on the website that would explain:\n\nWhat is where, e.g. proposals, standard library, package manager, website code etc.\nBasic workflow for each project. E.g. workflow for proposals is different from the workflow for stdlib or fpm, which is different from that of the website code;\nA list of items that we need help with the most from new contributors.\n\nThis info is basically already in each of the repositories. However, a dedicated single-page guide for all fortran-lang projects on the website would be helpful for people who aren't already proficient with GitHub. We want everybody who is willing to be able to join and participate.\nHow do we further lower barrier to entry?"

Originally I thought that personal projects should be out of scope for the newsletter. On the other side, it would be useful for readers to learn of new projects. They would need to be submitted for consideration, i.e. we don't want to list small toy projects that don't build or have docs. There would need to be some criterion on how to do this, like we have for including packages in the registry. I'm curious to hear what other think. Please write in #3. We don't have to rush for this newsletter, obviously we don't have a good idea yet how to do this.\nThis makes me think of another question: Should we include relevant (Fortran) new papers?

You can see the post here and the source file here. With Jekyll, like with most popular static site generators, you write posts in plain markdown, with html for any extras.\nTopics\nFirst, what topics/news should be covered by the newsletter. Here's my idea:\n\nEvents: conferences, meetups, and similar. These could be either announcements for upcoming events or briefings/reports from events that happened. They should be related to Fortran. A NumPy or weather prediction conference is probably off-topic. Fortran or HPC meetings are on topic.\nUpdates from J3 and WG5 meetings and developments of the language. Highlight proposals discussed. Like what @certik has been posting directly in issues in j3-fortran/fortran_proposals.\nFortran compiler releases\nNew development in fortran-lang projects: For example, highlighting new modules or functions in stdlib, or new fpm capability.\nNew packages available in the fpm registry.\nLast but not least, new Fortran releases (202x, 202y...). This one's pretty obvious. :)\nAnything else?\n\nWhat I think should be off-topic and omitted in newsletters:\n\nPersonal (non-community) Fortran projects, except listing them when they're added to the fpm registry.\nNews not directly about Fortran but that could be interesting to Fortran developers. Stuff about other languages etc.\n\nFormat\nI think we could have two kinds of newsletters:\n\nOff-schedule, topic-specific. This kind of newsletter covers only one item that is noteworthy. Examples: Fortran meetings, language releases, perhaps even compiler releases.\nMonthly, recurring. This kind of newsletter comes out periodically at the beginning of each month, summarizing the Fortran development and news from the previous month. It's formatted more as a summary rather than an in-depth coverage of a topic, so it can include on-topic odds and ends.\n\nHow should we work on it\nHere's what I propose:\n\nAnybody can open a PR for a newsletter\nMust assign a reviewer/editor. Can assign more than one if desired, ideally not too many. You don't want to have to wait for 5 people to review if you want timely news to go out.\nOf course, anybody can comment. If somebody thinks a PR doesn't make appropriate newsletter, they should say so.\nFor a monthly recurring newsletter, I suggest we open a draft PR at the beginning of each month, and we work on it as the month goes and new stuff happens. At the end of the month, we clean it up and merge.\n\nObviously, my PR #2 was not an example of this workflow. I just wanted to get something up quickly to use as an example.\nWe can automate posting of new newsletters to the @fortranlang Twitter using this. For people who use RSS readers, we have a feed on the website.\nWhat do you think? @certik @jvdp1 @ivan-pi @everythingfunctional @jacobwilliams @marshallward @zbeekman",

You can see the post here\n <https://fortran-lang.org/newsletter/2020/04/06/Announcing-FortranCon-2020/> and the source file here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.github.io/master/_posts/2020-04-06-Announcing-FortranCon-2020.md>. With Jekyll, like with most popular static site generators, you write posts in plain markdown, with html for any extras.\n\n Topics\n\n First, what topics/news should be covered by the newsletter. Here's my idea:\n\n  * Events: conferences, meetups, and similar. These could be either\n announcements for upcoming events or briefings/reports from events that\n happened. They should be related to Fortran. A NumPy or weather\n prediction conference is probably off-topic. Fortran or HPC meetings\n are on topic.\n  * Updates from J3 and WG5 meetings and developments of the language.\n Highlight proposals discussed. Like what @certik\n <https://github.com/certik> has been posting directly in issues in\n j3-fortran/fortran_proposals.\n  * Fortran compiler releases\n  * New development in fortran-lang projects: For example, highlighting\n new modules or functions in stdlib, or new fpm capability.\n  * New packages available in the fpm registry.\n  * Last but not least, new Fortran releases (202x, 202y...). This one's\n pretty obvious. :)\n  * Anything else?\n What I think should be off-topic and omitted in newsletters:\n\n  * Personal (non-community) Fortran projects, except listing them when\n they're added to the fpm registry.\n  * News not directly about Fortran but that could be interesting to\n Fortran developers. Stuff about other languages etc.\n Format\n\n I think we could have two kinds of newsletters:\n\n  * Off-schedule, topic-specific. This kind of newsletter covers only\n one item that is noteworthy. Examples: Fortran meetings, language\n releases, perhaps even compiler releases.\n  * Monthly, recurring. This kind of newsletter comes out periodically\n at the beginning of each month, summarizing the Fortran development and\n news from the previous month. It's formatted more as a summary rather\n than an in-depth coverage of a topic, so it can include on-topic odds\n and ends.\n How should we work on it\n\n Here's what I propose:\n\n  * Anybody can open a PR for a newsletter\n  * Must assign a reviewer/editor. Can assign more than one if desired,\n ideally not too many. You don't want to have to wait for 5 people to\n review if you want timely news to go out.\n  * Of course, anybody can comment. If somebody thinks a PR doesn't make\n appropriate newsletter, they should say so.\n  * For a monthly recurring newsletter, I suggest we open a draft PR at\n the beginning of each month, and we work on it as the month goes and\n new stuff happens. At the end of the month, we clean it up and merge.\n Obviously, my PR #2\n <#2> was not\n an example of this workflow. I just wanted to get something up quickly\n to use as an example.\n\n I will do some research how we can automate posting of new newsletters\n to the @fortranlang Twitter automatically, perhaps via GitHub Actions.\n For people who use RSS readers, we have a feed on the website.\n\n What do you think? @certik <https://github.com/certik> @jvdp1\n <https://github.com/jvdp1> @ivan-pi <https://github.com/ivan-pi>\n @everythingfunctional <https://github.com/everythingfunctional>\n @jacobwilliams <https://github.com/jacobwilliams> @marshallward\n <https://github.com/marshallward> @zbeekman\n <https://github.com/zbeekman>\n\n \u2014\n You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n <#3>, or\n unsubscribe\n <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAAFAWGVXFLSFXIVUCOQN43RMBNVDANCNFSM4MF7KBSQ>."
