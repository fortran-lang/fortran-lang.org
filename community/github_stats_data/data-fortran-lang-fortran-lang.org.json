If the site building finished successfully\na privileged action is triggered that then pushed\nthe site to the gh-pages branch and comments on the\nPR.\nI also added a check that prevents pushing\n\".github/workflows/\" files to the gh-pages branch, because\nthis would allow secret extraction and repository modification as well.\n(If you can add new workflows files you do what every you want inside them)",

The link above still works, but I deleted that repository a while ago, and last I remember that means it will actually vanish at some point. I had several things including the platform-independent plugin I wanted to try (particularly useful on MSWIndows which does not typically have the man(1) command unless installed via Cygwin or some form of Linux) and wanted to make a Fortran version of txt2man and so on, and was thinking that putting a group of the man-pages by category out each month on Fortran Discourse or Learn (or ...?) for  group comment/editing might be useful; have been planning on some time of migration to fortran-lang for something like a year and never quite had the time.  If what I have is a useful seed I am open to ideas on how to leverage it for this purpose. The way I have it now lets me just edit plain text and automatically convert it to the M_intrinsics module for use by the plugin and actual man-pages via txt2man(1) which are things I want and have set up (in a very singular way) as a push-button operation, including extracting and building all the example programs in the man pages and I did not want to loose that, but I think having at least the intrinsic descriptions sans vendor extensions (or explicitly marking them as such) is worth pursing and some of this shouldl be usable for that purpose."

Here i = 11\n\nbut the infinite do loop can emulate this behavior and is more general, since you can test the condition anywhere in the loop. In my codes I use do loops with indices and infinite do loops with exits, but not do while (although there is nothing wrong with it). So I suggest that the infinite do loop be presented in addition to or instead of do while. The equivalent to the code above would be\n  integer :: i\n  i = 1\n  do\n    if (i > 10) exit\n    print *, i\n    i = i + 1\n  end do\n  ! Here i = 11\n  print*,i\n  end\n\nThe code uses the one-line-if, which I suggested mentioning in another issue.\nThe sentence \"The do loop has an integer counter variable which is used to track which iteration of the loop is currently executing.\" should be qualified by putting \"usually\" or \"typically\" before \"has\", since infinite do loops do not have integer counters.",

However, reading the Derived types section, I think there is a jump in level starting with \"Derived types in detail\", which covers features from Fortran 2003+ (bind, extends, abstract) that I consider advanced. I would first discuss basic usage of derived types that existed in Fortran 95, such as\n(1) printing a derived type\n(2) using derived types as procedure arguments and function results\n(3) using arrays of derived types. In particular, the simple way that you can refer to the components of an array of derived types is a strength of Fortran. For example, given\ntype, public :: date_mdy \n   integer :: month, day, year\nend type date_mdy\ntype(date_mdy) :: dates(100)\n\nyou can refer to all the months, days, and years with dates%month, dates%day, dates%year.\nAfter this basic usage of derived types one could discuss operator overloading. Given a date derived type it is natural to define operators such as == and >. Examples could be given of how to do this.\nIf desired, I could write a section with a module defining a date derived type and a program using it.",

For Vasp you can use https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Installing_VASP.6.X.X which says Fortran (at least F2008 compliant), and for Turbomole you can use the manual https://www.turbomole.org/downloads/doc/Turbomole_Manual_7-5.pdf which mentions Fortran several times.\nSo we can use the public \"knowledge\" of such codes to determine candidates and then we can reach out to the company with a draft entry and see if they can confirm if it is indeed in Fortran and if they want it listed here and to approve or improve the entry (decription, tags, category, ...).\nWhat should be the criteria? \"Substantial parts of the core functionality written in Fortran\"? Given the commercial nature, obviously we cannot independently verify that, but we can simply trust the claims, and if it turns out later that something does not really satisfy the criteria, we can always remove it."

I am seeing that longer lines get soft-wrapped, which can be a bit confusing since the rendered blocks don't currently have line numbers.

For most of your points, as long as the style is consistent across the tutorials then the particular choice doesn't matter too much. Re indentation, I think we should go with 2 spaces with zero base indentation for reasons already discussed, and my preference would be to indent module procedures for readability as suggested by Sebastian. I would also like to avoid vertical aligning of :: and comments since this adds maintenance burden and pushes the line length in most cases. Once you settle on a set of rules for style, would you mind documenting them as a new section in the Style Guide? This will help others keep future edits consistent.\n\n\nwhat is meant by \"do concurrent is not a basic feature of Fortran\" in Operators and Control Flow?\n\n\nI'm not sure what is meant by this, please remove or reword as you see fit.\n\n\nwould a page on formatted printing and such fit here?\n\n\nYes absolutely, this would make a good addition to the quickstart tutorial."

As I noted in the last post there, I think it would be useful to work on this in a real-time collaborative markdown environment (e.g. GitBook) at first and then transfer to fork/pull request route once its more finalised.\nI see different levels of complexity and different use cases which could be covered here. For something on Fortran-lang.org I argue that focusing on established and well-maintained tools is the way to go. There are many packages out there that are either abandoned or have rapidly changing APIs. As I see it, there are two practical approaches to accessing Fortran code from Python:\n\nExplicitly write explicit C interface, build shared library and access via ctypes, cffi, Cython etc.\nUse interface generators which take care of everything under the hood and directly produces importable Python objects. Here the most mature would be f2py which is used in production-grade code like numpy and scipy.\n\nCode generators like Pyccel, Numba, Cython are in my view a bit of a different topic as their main goal is to enable users to write Python-like code that runs faster and not to actually generate Fortran code that could be used for something else. The user would be fairly agnostic whether it is Fortran, C or something else that is generated under the hood."

Overall I think the changes make it \"less opinionated\" which is I think better.\nI have two comments:\n\n\nin https://fortran-lang.org/pr/246/learn/best_practices/multidim_arrays it has been lost that you really want to loop over indices from the left for performance: https://www.fortran90.org/src/best-practices.html#multidimensional-arrays, so this information should be added there. The original has examples of this. We can perhaps add a subsection Performance and put this there.\n\n\nThe IO section seems more confusing: https://fortran-lang.org/pr/246/learn/best_practices/file_io than the original: https://www.fortran90.org/src/best-practices.html#file-input-output. Is the original wrong? I noticed the action keyword argument was added --- is that required by the standard or is it automatic? The three basic and most frequent operations are reading, writing and appending, so we can add such 3 subsections, and then we can add \"other\" and put the rest of the info there.\n\n\nOtherwise the changes are fine with me."

Here they are:\nCriteria:\n\nRelevant: The article should be about Fortran, or at least interesting to Fortran programmers.\nOriginal: The article should not have been published elsewhere, but adaptation from GitHub, Discourse, or Twitter threads is fine.\nHigh quality: The article provides meaningful and useful information, does not advertise a product or service, and is generally aligned with the Fortran-lang community.\n\nPoint 3 is especially subjective and difficult to quantify, so review will be important.\nProcess:\n\nThe Author opens an issue to propose an article, with a tentative title and short description.\nIf there are thumbs ups / go aheads at step 1, open a PR with the article, and request 3 reviewers.\nReviewers review and approve the article. Once published, it's distributed on usual channels (Discourse, mailing list, Twitter)\n\nWe'll discuss this on the call this week.",

The fortran-lang tutorial should not have code that would make a compiler writer \"cringe\". People have mentioned the benefit of x(:)= foo to prevent unintended allocation upon assignment, but in the tutorial examples, the arrays were not ALLOCATABLE.\n'A(:) = func(B(:), C(:))\nwith the (:) alerting the reader that the variable is an array (sort of like the Dave Barry joke that an apostrophe serves to warn you that the letter \u201cs\u201d is coming up in grocery store signs.) In Fortran syntax, (:) indicates an array section that starts at the first element and ends at the last element \u2013 the whole array, in other words.\nWhenever I see this usage, I cringe, because I know that the compiler has to work extra hard to recognize that the programmer really meant \u201cthe whole array\u201d and not a piece of it. In the past, unnecessary use of (:) would often prevent optimizations. Nowadays this is less often the case, thanks to hard work by the compiler developers, but sometimes it still happens.'"

Unfortunately, I also personally think the automatic re-allocation of the LHS was not a good decision in Fortran, because as @arjenmarkus correctly said, it will re-allocate the LHS unless you prevent it by using (:). For performance code, I don't want any kinds of shape checking code introduced by the compiler, citing Steve:\n\nThe downside, though, is that the checking required to support this is a lot of extra code, and applications where it is known that the array is already allocated to the correct shape don\u2019t need this check which would just slow them down.\n\nI agree.\nPerhaps equally bad, it will re-allocate the array if I made a mistake -- rather I want a nice compiler error message telling me (in Debug mode) that the shape does not match, or that my LHS was not allocated, but in Release mode I want things to run very fast an no checks.\nEven worse, imagine code that has no allocatable arrays, as in this tutorial. I strongly believe the syntax v(:) = 9 should not be used, just use v = 9. It looks much better and natural.\nExcept when then someone changes the array to be allocatable (I do that very often when developing), then the statement A = func(B) becomes problematic, because it might slow things down (due to the compiler now having to check shapes at runtime), and it will hide a bug, instead of giving an error right away that shapes do not match, it will silently re-allocate LHS and continue...\nSo for my codes, I never depend on automatic reallocation of LHS, and as such I could simply use the -fno-realloc-lhs option and check it at the CI, that way if somebody sends a PR that relies on automatic reallocation, the CI will not pass; So as long as the CI passes, the code itself will run correctly no matter if you use -fno-realloc-lhs or not, so that is nice. And so A(:) = func(B) is exactly the same as A = func(B), which is also nice and so the shorter version without (:) should be used.\nHowever, unfortunately because there is code now written by many people out there that does depend on automatic reallocation of LHS, that code will not work in my project, and would need fixing.\nI don't have a good solution..."

Some common platforms are\n(1) Windows x86\n(2) Windows Subsystem for Linux\n(3) Linux x86\n(4) Apple on Intel\n(5) Apple Silicon\nand others could list more.\nFor (1) I know from personal experience that gfortran, Intel, and g95, Lahey/Fujitsu Fortran 95, and Salford work, and there are other compilers. For (2) I have used gfortran and flang/clang 7.0.1. (This flang is not mature. I've read that there is a distinct \"classic flang\".)\nIn another issue the question of providing objective information about compilers was discussed. At least the existence of compilers for platforms can be summarized objectively.",

That way they can advertise as they wish. We can perhaps put a paragraph at the very top explaining this.\nThe alternative is to start editing the paragraph for each compiler, but I don't have access to all of them, and I don't want to be in a position either to be the \"editor\" for how compilers are described and advertised.\nBy offloading this responsibility to the compiler vendors themselves, and just providing a venue and \"rules\" (100 words or less), and making those rules clear (currently it is not clear) seems better and ultimately fair I think.\nUpdate: to explain why I don't want to be the \"editor\": first, I am in a conflict of interest, as I am the primary developer of the LFortran compiler. Second, even if I wasn't, I don't feel we should be \"judging\" or \"comparing\" commercial compilers (or even open source compilers). Rather, let the users decide. The only judging we made was to roughly order the compilers based on our perceived usage in the community of them. If there was some more objective measure, we could use that instead. But other than that, my vision was to provide the platform, so that at least all the compilers are now sitting at the same table. But other than that, let each compiler speak for themselves. To more objectively compare compilers, we created this benchmark repository: https://github.com/fortran-lang/benchmarks/, we haven't had time to actually populate it, but we will. Benchmarking objectively is very hard, see the discussion here: fortran-lang/benchmarks#2 and at the other issues there. I think there is a way to do it, to simply show the numbers and let users decide. Another idea is an automated results of \"Fortran features support\", where we run each compiler with a test suite and report how well it is supported. But even if we had all that infrastructure for more objective comparisons (we currently don't), I still don't want to be writing the final \"summary\", but rather I just want users to try the compilers out (or not) and decide themselves.\nCC @milancurcic."

Consider such a beginner who, looking for help, goes to CLF with their query but is met with curt unaccommodating responses, as is common there, and thus leaves with a negative impression of the Fortran community and motivation to not continue pursuing Fortran.\nWith Reddit, which is more likely to attract young people, the Fortran community is not so active and so answers can vary in helpfulness, accuracy and accommodation. This again influences initial experiences for Fortran beginners.\nBy placing links on our site there is an implicit endorsement, which IMHO isn't deserved by either CLF or Reddit as recommended Fortran communities.\nWith this reflection I'd revise my previous comment to say that I am opposed to CLF and Reddit being listed."

I fully agree that we cannot promote communities that are unaccommodating or hostile to any group of users or do not meet our community standards.\nWhile I agree that the perception of Fortran for beginners is important, I want to highlight that the tagline of the learn page reads Learning resources for beginners and experts alike and we include in the same section expert literature like the 2018 standard interpretation document which could also scare off beginners. So the scope of the learn resources is broader than the perception generated for Fortran beginners."

Moving all the content to the translation file is also inacceptable in my opinion, because we would end up with a single yml file for the complete content of the English main tree.\ngettext has the great advantage that we are actually replacing strings with a safe fallback, it allows to write the page in the default language as usual and add a translation on top afterwards with a po-file in an automatic and safe way.

If the general layout (_i18n /_layouts) is kept fixed, the final aspect of the footer is modified by adding words with a greater number of characters. Some \"line breaks\" are introduced.\n\nThanks, @vmagnin. Yes, my comment is a bit confusing.\nPerhaps the following images describe better,\nFooter in the English version\n\nFooter in the Spanish version"

Would it be possible to display the same information for those developed on GitLab?\n\n\nWould it be possible to give more information (ideally in the submission documentation) about how the version information works?  Its purpose is not very clear at the moment. Is that the version that package rapporteurs will be checking?  Do other versions need to meet the criteria too?  Are there any plans to create version-based links (so the version string must match a tag in the repository)?\n\n\nThank you.",

However, at the time, I struggled with my HTML and CSS to make it look pretty so in interest of time I dropped it and moved on. Then I forgot about it.\nFirst question is, should the landing page have an example code syntax, nicely styled, syntax-colored, some minimal but real-world example? The purpose is to show what Fortran looks and feels like, on a first impression to a newcomer to the language.\nSecond, if the answer is yes (and I think so), can you please think of and propose some example snippets that you think would be good for this? Then we can all discuss them and choose our favorite.\nThird, are you interested in making this happen? It should be a relatively low-hanging fruit, with I think a high ROI. It would probably require basic-to-intermediate HTML+CSS skills and a basic sense of good design.\nHere are examples for inspiration, some pretty, some not so pretty:\n\nPython\nGo\nNim\nElixir\nRuby\nHaskell",

Here is the original:\n\n program laplaceimplicit noneinteger, parameter :: dp=kind(0.d0), N=100, Niter=80000real(dp) :: u(N,N)integer :: i\n u(1,:) = 1; u(2:,:) = 0do i = 1, Niter\n     u(2:N-1,2:N-1) = ((u(3:,2:N-1) + u(:N-2,2:N-1)) + &\n         (u(2:N-1,3:) + u(2:N-1,:N-2))) / 4end doprint *, sum(u), sum(u**2)end program\n\n And here is the explicit stencil version:\n\n program laplaceimplicit noneinteger, parameter :: dp=kind(0.d0), N=100, Niter=80000real(dp) :: u(N,N)integer :: i, j, m\n u(1,:) = 1; u(2:,:) = 0do m = 1, Niter\n     do j = 2, N-1\n     do i = 2, N-1\n         u(i,j) = (u(i+1,j) + u(i-1,j) + u(i,j+1) + u(i,j-1)) / 4\n     end do\n     end doend doprint *, sum(u), sum(u**2)end program\n\n The first and second version produce the following numbers, respectively:\n\n    2500.9999999998840        1356.5191481174465\n    2500.9999999998754        1356.5191481174404\n\n For smaller iteration numbers they differ slightly because the first\n version updates the whole array at once, while the second version is\n reusing the new value in the next stencil, but as iterations progress, both\n versions converge towards the same result.\n\n \u2014\n You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n <#174 (comment)>,\n or unsubscribe\n <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAN6YR42IELQKEDJYSFJES3TTUF37ANCNFSM4UMBJH2Q>\n ."

The idea is to show some interesting and unusual approaches how to actually use make to solve problems, going beyond the stuff you will usually find in a random Makefile.\nThe automation of the dependencies is one of the main issues faced when using make for Fortran projects, of course one can hard code them in the Makefile and avoid the topic, but this is in my opinion not a good answer on how to deal with module dependencies in make.\nIf this is not suited for the building programs book, I would suggest to start a new book on build systems and development tools as intermediate minibook instead."

To keep it simple, I\nwill describe what I understand regarding the GCC compiler suite:\nmingw64.exe: a program compiled with the GCC compilers understands the\nWindows-style path names, the home directory I get with \"echo $HOME\" is\n\"/home/markus\", but if I ask in a C program for the current directory if I\nam in my home directory, I get \"c:\\msys64-2020\\home\\markus\\\".\nI can copy the program to another machine or run it in a plain command\nwindow without any problem.\n\nmsys2.exe: if I do the same under this shell, I have a different version of\nthe compiler and the run-time libraries. The result of getcwd() would then\nbe Unixy - \"/home/markus\". And the program does not work outside the MSYS2\nenvironment, as it would miss a crucial DLL.\n\n\nOp di 20 okt. 2020 om 21:50 schreef Laurence Kedward <\nnotifications@github.com>:\n\u2026\n Hi @arjenmarkus <https://github.com/arjenmarkus>, the current text on\n MSYS2 and MinGW was written by myself.

However it should be clear that the MinGW-w64 toolchain is separate to MSYS2 and can be distributed independent of it.\nFurther, when you use the native MSYS2 shell, the compiler toolchain is not MinGW, but an MSYS2 native build of gcc.\nThe text I have written makes the assumption that the reader will use one of the MinGW shells in MSYS2 as opposed to the 'native' MSYS2 shell which should only be used for writing programs to distribute in MSYS2.\nTo be clear, the following compile environments are available:\n\nMinGW-w64: compiler toolchain only (no shell), links with Microsoft libs (native Windows), called from Windows shell\nMSYS2/mingw64: MinGW-w64 compiler toolchain provided as an MSYS2 package, links with Microsoft libs, called from MSYS2 shell\nMSYS2/mingw32: same as above with 32bit x-compile target\nMSYS2/MSYS2: GNU compiler collection compiled within the POSIX environment provided by MSYS2, links with msys-2.0.dll\n\nI will update the text tomorrow to make it simpler and clearer to a beginner."

I also tried to correct all licenses which are not valid SPDX license identifiers. Many missing licenses were malformatted BSD or MIT licenses, but some had actually interesting licensing condition like original MIT license with changes under BSD-3-Clause and so on.\nThere are still some issues with the GPL-2.0, and GPL-3.0, which should have the -only or -or-later suffix.

Its existence begins when execution of the function is initiated and ends when execution of the\nfunction is terminated. However, because the final value of this entity is used subsequently in the evaluation\nof the expression that invoked the function, an implementation might defer releasing the storage occupied\nby that entity until after its value has been used in expression evaluation."

The project ships with a code generator that is written in OCaml and generates Fortran code compiled and linked as shared libraries. Our development is done in a (non-openly visible) gitlab server at the University of Siegen, whose reviewed merge requests are mirrored to our public gitlab server in Siegen and an svn repository at Hepforge. Distribution tarballs are also available via http://launchpad.net/whizard. We are using both OpenMP and MPI for parallelized Monte Carlo integration and simulation, in our development version using also non-blocking communication. Two of our team members, Wolfgang Kilian and J\u00fcrgen Reuter, are relatively active on c.l.f., the Intel forum, and the gfortran bugzilla.",

            "text": "I suggest that we have to have and maintain our own benchmarks and have a dedicated section for it.\nAs an example, the Julia page has benchmarks against Fortran, but unfortunately they do not enable all optimization flags in gfortran, and when I pointed that to them, they said that they do not want to do that because they have different priorities in what they want to benchmark: JuliaLang/julia#24568, which is fine, they have the right to do that. But it is then misleading to users when they think that Fortran is not that fast.\nTo fix that, we have to maintain our own benchmarks, and test them with several Fortran compilers, and ensure that all optimization options are enabled. And we should benchmark against other languages.\nThis will also provide motivation for Fortran compiler vendors to speed up some of these benchmarks if Fortran is not the fastest.\nHere are some ideas for benchmarks to include:\n\nhttps://julialang.org/benchmarks/\nhttps://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/fortran.html\nhttps://github.com/ParRes/Kernels\n...",

For C++, we should include an equivalent code, we specifically should not allow to include assembly instrinsics like this one: https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/program/nbody-gpp-7.html, full of assembly intrinsics. More specifically, we should mention it that you can of course write this in assembly (or inline it in C++ in various ways), but in our main benchmarks, we should put code that people would actually write to solve the problem in the given language itself without resolving to assembly. The same with the Rust version that currently is the fastest: https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/program/nbody-rust-7.html, it's full of assembly intrinsics.\nThen we can have a section where anything is allowed, including assembly.\nThe idea is that with enough expertise, the best is to optimize in assembly. For example OpenBLAS is mostly in assembly. But the point of the benchmarks is to see how fast can you get if you only stick to the language and canonical ways of doing things in the language.\nTo put it another way: our benchmarks should show, that Fortran is an excellent choice for this mission:\n\nenable scientists, engineers, and other domain experts to write programs that naturally express the mathematics and algorithms employed, are portable across HPC systems, remain viable over decades of use, and extract a high percentage of performance from the underlying hardware."

            "text": "We discussed website tutorials on our June 19 call and we tentatively agreed to organize the mini-books that teach the language itself around topics, rather than skill level. Each mini-book would then cover the topic with increasing skill level, starting from the most basic concepts and building toward more advanced.\nThis is specific to the mini-books that teach the language itself. We'd still have other mini-books that cover other topics like building programs, best practices, Rosetta code and similar.\nOn the call a few people suggested that we discuss what should be the topics to cover. I think we should aim to define topics that are mostly complementary, have little overlap between each other (but it's impossible to completely avoid overlap). Here are the topics that I think would work well:\n\nBuilt-in types and operators\nControl flow\nProcedures\nModules\nArrays\nStrings\nDerived types\nI/O\nOOP\nParallel programming\nC-interop\n\nAs an example of building skill level within a topic, mini-book on parallel programming would cover all parallel concepts, from basic to advanced: Images, synchronization, coarrays, collectives, teams, events, and perhaps even some example parallel algorithms.\nIn this approach, a user of any skill level who wants to learn or refresh memory on any aspect of the language, knows where to look for it because the mini-books are organized by topic. Once in the mini-book, they can skip forward to more advanced aspects of a topic if needed.\nHow this all evolves exactly in practice, I don't know. Perhaps @LKedward will have some ideas. Perhaps we just expand the sections in the existing Quickstart until they become complete enough to warrant transitioning them into a dedicated mini-book.\nWhat do you think?",

I like your topic breakdown - this gives us a good starting point!\nWhere there is overlap between topics, will we be referring the reader to the corresponding mini-book (as a recommended prerequisite) or will we be repeating the content in both mini-books? The obvious examples I can think of are Procedures/Interfaces being prerequisite for Modules/C-interop and Derived types being prerequisite to OOP.\nThe problem with repeated content is increased maintainer workload and potential confusion for readers as to where best to go for a topic. The former problem can probably be solved by sharing pages between mini-books in the yaml file but I feel this exacerbates the latter issue of confusing readers.\nIMO, I think for these situations it is best not to repeat content and to recommend pre-requisite mini-books in the introduction of the dependent mini-book. The disadvantage of this approach is that the mini-books are not perfectly self-contained but partially interdependent.\nThere is a question about the future of the Quickstart mini-book - I would prefer to keep the mini-book as a brief overview of the main language features but with links to the other mini-books for each topic in detail. The Quickstart mini-book would not be part of the core language mini-books but the 'Other' mini-books.\nFinally, your proposed Parallel Programming book is a Coarray Parallel Programming book - I want to ask whether we are going to additionally cover MPI, OpenMP, and OpenACC as well. IMO we should include these, each in a separate mini-book, because they are well-established standards and I don't see any reason to arbitrarily limit the tutorial content to just the Fortran standard."

Recently I was at an OpenMP training course where I discovered they have a lot of nice training material also for Fortran. The book by Dragos B. Chirila also contains an OpenMP chapter in the context of Fortran.\nAn overview of solutions for GPU programming including CUDA, OpenCL, OpenMP, and OpenACC from the Fortran perspective would also be nice. I understand however, that the goal of coarrays was exactly to remove the burden of having to learn all of these standards and focus instead on the actual problem. There is a recent paper where they attempted to use coarrays on GPUs.\nWe could also ask the developers of these standards if they are willing to contribute a mini-book."

The obvious examples I can think of are Procedures/Interfaces being prerequisite for Modules/C-interop and Derived types being prerequisite to OOP.\n\nI also think referring the reader to other mini-books, rather than repetition, is better. One technique I learned from Manning is that if a mini-book (chapter) strongly depends on another, for example the way OOP depends on derived types, then at the beginning of the mini-book we can state clearly:\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you have a good grasp of the derived types. If you don't, please work through the derived types mini-book first.\n\nor similar. Another technique is to add a reference to a definition whenever we first bring up a term that we won't define here. For example, in OOP, when we first show a listing with a derived type in it, we can say something like:\n\nThis is a derived type, which is described in <link to derived type mini-book>.\n\n\nFinally, your proposed Parallel Programming book is a Coarray Parallel Programming book - I want to ask whether we are going to additionally cover MPI, OpenMP, and OpenACC as well.

If there is not a clear winner, then we'll have to decide what to do. We spent a lot of time on this before, so I would prefer, if possible, that we don't waste weeks of time on this again. I understand if the current setup is irritating, that people are unhappy. If we switch, it will be irritating to some others. I personally definitely prefer 4 spaces, just like in Python and C++ (however I do not indent inside modules and subroutines, to save horizontal space), but I will go with whatever the community prefers based on the votes, and if it's 2 spaces, we can do that."

My thinking is that this Quickstart tutorial is meant for people who already know how to program, they are most probably experienced programmers in another language and want a quick \"get up to speed\" with modern Fortran.  In that sense everyone, more or less is accustomed with OOP features, and would expect to learn how to implement the basic OOP features in Fortran syntax."

It reads more like reference than learning material."

The only Jekyll issue that I see is actually nothing about Jekyll but with gem and bundler, which IMO just plain suck. Especially when you start using specific versions. Tracebacks are inscrutable.\nHugo was actually what I started working with at first and then gave up after few hours. I was somewhat familiar with Jekyll already, and Hugo is overall more complex so there was more to learn.\nSo setting up the tooling to run Jekyll is worse than Hugo. But after you do that once, I think Jekyll is easier to work with than Hugo. Personal opinion of course.\nBuild previews that @LKedward made mostly solves this. If you know how to submit a PR, there's no need to run locally. For writing markdown pages and submitting content this is good enough. If you need to make structural changes to the website, chances are that setting up Jekyll is not an issue."

Also, the myst parser does allow us to use markdown almost on par with reStructuredText which is really a step up from the kramdown parser. As a plus point we could use reStructuredText as well to write minibooks.\nIt is still a huge effort, but we would be using Python rather than Ruby, which most of you are probably more familiar with.

Do you have any thoughts on what could go in this? Perhaps we should open an issue to discuss that.\n\n@LKedward I think you refer to this. I apologize that I didn't provide feedback back in that thread. I didn't in part because I haven't gotten clear my self with the best way forward, and this in a difficult problem to solve.\nI like the approach of mini-books over one large monolithic book. However, we're currently unclear what the specific mini-books are and what separates them. When you separate a subject matter into multiple parts (mini-books) you need to decide how to separate them. You can do it in different ways:\n\nBy topic (compiling and linking, arrays, control flow, OOP, etc.)\nBy reader skill level (intro, advanced, expert)\nBy teaching method (tutorial, reference, cookbook, FAQ, best practices)\n\nDifferent teaching methods serve different purposes, so I think we all agree we need separation by teaching method (e.g. we'll have best practices from fortran90.org etc.). There are kind of a neutral ground mini-books, because they will tend to touch on all of the topics, and be useful to programmers of all skill levels.\nHowever, please, please be cautious of separating mini-books by both topic and skill level at the same time. By doing that you have to assume which topics are basic or advanced. And by assuming that you're assuming about what the reader needs. Which I don't think we can or should assume.\nAnother problem is overlap in content. Inevitably, both the intro and advanced mini-books will cover I/O, arrays, derived types etc. There will be a lot of repetition and cross-referencing. An average reader won't know ahead of time where the specific feature they're looking for is described.\nI urge everybody here to discuss and decide whether to separate by topic or by skill level, but please don't do both. We'll end up with many messy and complicated books.\nMy preference is to separate by topic (e.g. mini-book on arrays, I/O, OOP, parallelism, interop etc.), and each successive section of a mini-book builds gradually in depth and skill level. Of course, some topics will depend on others, and we'll end up with a natural sequence of mini-books that form a nice, coherent, large book, just like the Rust book. Which is what we wanted in the first place. :)"

Based off this previous conversation, this is also my preferred method of separation.\n@milancurcic, my mention of an \"Intermediate Fortran\" book may have caused confusion - by this I meant that it would be good to have a follow-on book from the Quickstart tutorial that covers more advanced topics that are not already contained within the Quickstart tutorial. i.e. they are split by topic where multiple topics are grouped within a book. This would be more of a \"Further Fortran\" book.\nI realise that it may be preferable to have more topic granularity at the book level (one topic per book), however I also don't think we should have ~10 books each consisting of ~3 paragraphs to start off with.\n\nthis in a difficult problem to solve.\n\nAbsolutely, the idea behind the mini-books is to give us as much flexibility in structuring the content while also enabling us to publish content incrementally instead of in large tranches.\nMy idea was that topics can start off as sections and be expanded to pages and then broken-out into stand-alone books, as more content is added."

So the translation with Pandoc will be very fast, the longest work will be to verify that every thing is OK. Perhaps a simple copy/paste of the texts of both versions, and a diff on the two resulting files could accelerate that validation.\nThen will begin the integration to the website.\nI propose beginning working myself on the Pandoc and validation step.

At first glance, it looks now fine, except for the escaped \\$ in the OpenMP directives (only three occurrences).\nIn the rosetta.rst page, there is a mandelbrot.png image. Curiously, despite the --resource-path=../images option, I had to modify the path ![image](/images/mandelbrot.png) to  ![image](../images/mandelbrot.png).\nThe --shift-heading-level-by=1 is for starting headings at <h2>, like specified in the style guide.\nNow my objective is to first work on a PR for best-practices.md.  There is two possibilities:\n\na single-page mini-book: although that page is quite long, we could put it quickly online and later, as the text is revised, slice it into a multi-page mini-book.\nworking directly on a multi-page mini-book.\n\nRemarks concerning code indentation:\nit is generally 4 spaces. As far as I understand, the discussions #101 and https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/should-tutorials-on-fortran-lang-org-follow-a-consistent-style-for-code-listings/134/18 seem OK with that although other tutorials seem to be rather 2 spaces.

Regarding the header, you only need to change the title field to the title of your tutorial\nand the permalink field to something like permalink: /learn/building_programs - this will cause the web address of your tutorial to be https://fortran-lang.org/learn/building_programs. The ending after /learn/ just needs to be a short descriptive string for your tutorial. The other fields (layout, navbar) can be kept the same as in the index file.\nI'm not sure if we are using a different license for the tutorial content - the website source is currently licensed under MIT, but it may be a good idea to license the tutorials under one of the CC-BY licenses. As the author and copyright holder, the licensing of the tutorial content is ultimately your choice - but it would be good to agree a license for all tutorial and similar content on fortran-lang.org.

But I trust @certik and if he says that OpenBLAS has a meaningful and useful Fortran binding, I'm okay with it.\nI want to also caution about the \"Interfaces\" category. If you looked at our existing categories, you'll see that \"Interfaces\" is the only category that says \"how something works\" rather than \"what it does\".\nSimilar to @LKedward, for me by far the main purpose of this page is for new developers to be able to find the tool they need for their Fortran work. Not so much for us to prove there are pure Fortran packages out there, or to be proud of it. That too is important, but is secondary to me.\nIn that sense, when a newcomer to Fortran arrives to the packages page, the \"Interfaces\" category is the only one that doesn't really tell them what's in there, only that the packages in there are bindings to other languages. However, I don't think this category is necessarily harmful, and is okay to keep it."

It's a great library.\nYes, LAPACK predates iso_c_binding, and OpenBLAS just follows what LAPACK does. The tradition there is to just provide the symbols and hope that they work (but they do in practice, even if I don't recommend to do that for new projects).\nSo let's put it into into interfaces.\nI think we are in agreement --- for you and @LKedward the main purpose is to list packages that are useful for Fortran developers to use. For me that is part of it. But equally important for me is to leverage our community and connect us to each other and to show what is out there, and showing how Fortran can be used --- because I think we absolutely have to prove that Fortran can be used for new projects and for new developments.

As discussed, the interface is not iso_c_binding interface, but it's the old fashioned LAPACK interface. However it works.\nSo I am going to close this PR, I think OpenBLAS can stay where it is.

So how about we rename this repository to fortran-lang.org, to keep all the history, stars, issues, etc.\nThen we create a new repository that would actually serve fortran-lang.org. So that it is not confusing, perhaps it can be called fortran-lang.org.deploy or something like that.\nAnd then setup a CI at fortran-lang.org that checks each PR (it builds it and pushes somewhere to be looked at, not at fortran-lang.org), and then every master will get built and pushed into fortran-lang.org.deploy to be served at fortran-lang.org.\n\nWe have to keep the rendered html at fortran-lang.github.io since this is a so-called organisation site which serves the site at https://<organization>.github.io. If we use any other repository it will not be an organisation site but simply a project site which is not served at the site root but under https://<organization>.github.io/<repository>.\nSee here for full explanation:\nhttps://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites\nMy proposition is similarly based on a two repository approach, but the unbuilt source (current repo contents) is moved to a new repository and fortran-lang.github.io is used for deployment via CI for the reasons mentioned above.\nUnfortunately as I said, and as you point out, it is an upheaval meaning stars, issues etc are effectively lost."

Many repos could fall in that are either unusable or semi-usable, or they're a slight modification of another project.\nAs you say, we need to decide what makes a package relevant enough. I think some requirements should be:\n\nPure Fortran or mixed-language project where Fortran is the majority of the code (or > than some % of the code).

I expected that it meant \"Explore Fortran language\" which would be more like a tutorial. Should we use a more specific word here, perhaps \"Packages\"?\nFortran-lang organisation projects: I'd like to de-empasize \"organization\" and emphasize community. I suggest rewording this header as \"Fortran-lang community projects\", and adding this website and repo as the 3rd project. I'd like us to encourage people to discover this website as an editable and contributable project in motion, rather than a static place on the internet.\nFeatured community projects: Considering point above, then we should reword this to avoid confusion with this specific community (fortran-lang.org) and because not all projects listed are community projects. Perhaps a broader header, Featured open source projects is more appropriate.\n\nCategory sub-pages: I recommend not navigating to a level 3 sub-page for each category, but to have one longer page (level 2) that lists all categories and projects, with a hyperlinked category TOC at the top. Then the visitor could easily browse all categories and packages without navigating away. I personally start to get lost when websites have level 3 sub-page.\nSpecific categories: I don't think these categories work well. Specifically, they're all broad and have overlap between each other. I suggest having more specific and narrowly defined categories, like Linear Algebra, Simulation, Graphics, General purpose, and perhaps others.\n\n\n\nThe rewording suggestions are probably easy to implement here. If you agree, you can include them as part of this PR.\nFor others I suggest we open specific follow-up PRs to improve each part of the page."

The category system is very extensible, so future PRs can refine easily.\n\nThis is great, thank you so much @LKedward !\nWe need to ensure all the codes from https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/wiki/List-of-popular-open-source-Fortran-projects are there.\n\nThanks @certik, I've been through that whole list now; for this initial PR I've prioritised adding libraries and modules that would be of use to Fortran programmers over large domain-specific scientific applications. Having been through the list (and as you note also) I find that the number of stars is actually a poor indicator of package utility IMHO. I find they are much more like social media 'likes' - we see this in the skew towards large scientific applications, which are domain-specific and hence of limited utility to the wider Fortran community.

And you can use an email.\nI wondered for LFortran a lot, whether we need a mailinglist or not, initially we just setup Zulip. But later we created a mailinglist, so that I can post my updates there, and we can have a general discussion from time to time if needed.\nFor example: we should have a medium where we can announce the FortranCon, and other things and have means for people to discuss it.

Discourse is probably the closest to a mailinglist.\nThe kind of discussions that people would have are visible e.g. here:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.lang.fortran\nYou can see that anyone can post an announcement of a new project or a new idea or a new conference, and then people can discuss and comment.

There is GitHub Help documentation, but to be honest I don't think it will be helpful. Instead, I recommend just exploring and trying to find your way through practice. It looks quite busy at first but you get used to it.\nIf you'd like, I'm happy to get on a Zoom video call with you to guide you via shared screen. Just let me know.\nOtherwise, the best place for you to start is the J3 Fortran proposals repo:\nhttps://github.com/j3-fortran/fortran_proposals/issues\nYou will find many discussion topics there, a few of them evolved into J3 papers. I suggest to read those, and post in whichever you want.\n\nBut your point also makes me think of this: We should probably have a dedicated \"Contributor's guide\" page on the website that would explain:\n\nWhat is where, e.g. proposals, standard library, package manager, website code etc.\nBasic workflow for each project. E.g. workflow for proposals is different from the workflow for stdlib or fpm, which is different from that of the website code;\nA list of items that we need help with the most from new contributors.\n\nThis info is basically already in each of the repositories. However, a dedicated single-page guide for all fortran-lang projects on the website would be helpful for people who aren't already proficient with GitHub. We want everybody who is willing to be able to join and participate.\nHow do we further lower barrier to entry?"

Originally I thought that personal projects should be out of scope for the newsletter. On the other side, it would be useful for readers to learn of new projects. They would need to be submitted for consideration, i.e. we don't want to list small toy projects that don't build or have docs. There would need to be some criterion on how to do this, like we have for including packages in the registry. I'm curious to hear what other think. Please write in #3. We don't have to rush for this newsletter, obviously we don't have a good idea yet how to do this.\nThis makes me think of another question: Should we include relevant (Fortran) new papers?

You can see the post here and the source file here. With Jekyll, like with most popular static site generators, you write posts in plain markdown, with html for any extras.\nTopics\nFirst, what topics/news should be covered by the newsletter. Here's my idea:\n\nEvents: conferences, meetups, and similar. These could be either announcements for upcoming events or briefings/reports from events that happened. They should be related to Fortran. A NumPy or weather prediction conference is probably off-topic. Fortran or HPC meetings are on topic.\nUpdates from J3 and WG5 meetings and developments of the language. Highlight proposals discussed. Like what @certik has been posting directly in issues in j3-fortran/fortran_proposals.\nFortran compiler releases\nNew development in fortran-lang projects: For example, highlighting new modules or functions in stdlib, or new fpm capability.\nNew packages available in the fpm registry.\nLast but not least, new Fortran releases (202x, 202y...). This one's pretty obvious. :)\nAnything else?\n\nWhat I think should be off-topic and omitted in newsletters:\n\nPersonal (non-community) Fortran projects, except listing them when they're added to the fpm registry.\nNews not directly about Fortran but that could be interesting to Fortran developers. Stuff about other languages etc.\n\nFormat\nI think we could have two kinds of newsletters:\n\nOff-schedule, topic-specific. This kind of newsletter covers only one item that is noteworthy. Examples: Fortran meetings, language releases, perhaps even compiler releases.\nMonthly, recurring. This kind of newsletter comes out periodically at the beginning of each month, summarizing the Fortran development and news from the previous month. It's formatted more as a summary rather than an in-depth coverage of a topic, so it can include on-topic odds and ends.\n\nHow should we work on it\nHere's what I propose:\n\nAnybody can open a PR for a newsletter\nMust assign a reviewer/editor. Can assign more than one if desired, ideally not too many. You don't want to have to wait for 5 people to review if you want timely news to go out.\nOf course, anybody can comment. If somebody thinks a PR doesn't make appropriate newsletter, they should say so.\nFor a monthly recurring newsletter, I suggest we open a draft PR at the beginning of each month, and we work on it as the month goes and new stuff happens. At the end of the month, we clean it up and merge.\n\nObviously, my PR #2 was not an example of this workflow. I just wanted to get something up quickly to use as an example.\nWe can automate posting of new newsletters to the @fortranlang Twitter using this. For people who use RSS readers, we have a feed on the website.\nWhat do you think? @certik @jvdp1 @ivan-pi @everythingfunctional @jacobwilliams @marshallward @zbeekman",

You can see the post here\n <https://fortran-lang.org/newsletter/2020/04/06/Announcing-FortranCon-2020/> and the source file here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.github.io/master/_posts/2020-04-06-Announcing-FortranCon-2020.md>. With Jekyll, like with most popular static site generators, you write posts in plain markdown, with html for any extras.\n\n Topics\n\n First, what topics/news should be covered by the newsletter. Here's my idea:\n\n  * Events: conferences, meetups, and similar. These could be either\n announcements for upcoming events or briefings/reports from events that\n happened. They should be related to Fortran. A NumPy or weather\n prediction conference is probably off-topic. Fortran or HPC meetings\n are on topic.\n  * Updates from J3 and WG5 meetings and developments of the language.\n Highlight proposals discussed. Like what @certik\n <https://github.com/certik> has been posting directly in issues in\n j3-fortran/fortran_proposals.\n  * Fortran compiler releases\n  * New development in fortran-lang projects: For example, highlighting\n new modules or functions in stdlib, or new fpm capability.\n  * New packages available in the fpm registry.\n  * Last but not least, new Fortran releases (202x, 202y...). This one's\n pretty obvious. :)\n  * Anything else?\n What I think should be off-topic and omitted in newsletters:\n\n  * Personal (non-community) Fortran projects, except listing them when\n they're added to the fpm registry.\n  * News not directly about Fortran but that could be interesting to\n Fortran developers. Stuff about other languages etc.\n Format\n\n I think we could have two kinds of newsletters:\n\n  * Off-schedule, topic-specific. This kind of newsletter covers only\n one item that is noteworthy. Examples: Fortran meetings, language\n releases, perhaps even compiler releases.\n  * Monthly, recurring. This kind of newsletter comes out periodically\n at the beginning of each month, summarizing the Fortran development and\n news from the previous month. It's formatted more as a summary rather\n than an in-depth coverage of a topic, so it can include on-topic odds\n and ends.\n How should we work on it\n\n Here's what I propose:\n\n  * Anybody can open a PR for a newsletter\n  * Must assign a reviewer/editor. Can assign more than one if desired,\n ideally not too many. You don't want to have to wait for 5 people to\n review if you want timely news to go out.\n  * Of course, anybody can comment.
