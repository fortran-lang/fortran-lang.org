"Fortran has been designed from the ground up for computationally "
"intensive applications in science and engineering. Mature and battle-"

" the metal, fast."

msgid ""
"Fortran is statically and strongly typed, which allows the compiler to "
"catch many programming errors early on for you. This also allows the "
"compiler to generate efficient binary code."

"Fortran is a relatively small language that is surprisingly easy to learn"
" and use. Expressing most mathematical and arithmetic operations over "
"large arrays is as simple as writing them as equations on a whiteboard."

"Fortran is a natively parallel programming language with intuitive array-"
"like syntax to communicate data between CPUs. You can run almost the same"
" code on a single CPU, on a shared-memory multicore system, or on a "
"distributed-memory HPC or cloud-based system. Coarrays, teams, events, "
"and collective subroutines allow you to express different parallel "
"programming patterns that best fit your problem at hand."

" the next one, with the working title Fortran 202x, is planned for "
