    Features

    High performance

Fortran has been designed from the ground up for computationally intensive applications in science and engineering. Mature and battle-tested compilers and libraries allow you to write code that runs close to the metal, fast.

    Statically and strongly typed

Fortran is statically and strongly typed, which allows the compiler to catch many programming errors early on for you. This also allows the compiler to generate efficient binary code.

    Easy to learn and use

Fortran is a relatively small language that is surprisingly easy to learn and use. Expressing most mathematical and arithmetic operations over large arrays is as simple as writing them as equations on a whiteboard.

    Versatile

Fortran allows you to write code in a style that best fits your problem: imperative, procedural, array-oriented, object-oriented, or functional.

    Natively parallel

Fortran is a natively parallel programming language with intuitive array-like syntax to communicate data between CPUs. You can run almost the same code on a single CPU, on a shared-memory multicore system, or on a distributed-memory HPC or cloud-based system. Coarrays, teams, events, and collective subroutines allow you to express different parallel programming patterns that best fit your problem at hand.

    FAQ

.. div:: sd-fs-5 sd-font-weight-bold 

    What is the status of Fortran?

Fortran is still in active development. The latest revision of the language is `Fortran 2018 <https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=19441669&objAction=Open>`_,and the next one, with the working title Fortran 202x, is planned for release in the next few years. Further, open source projects like the `Standard Library <https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib>`_ and the `Fortran Package Manager <https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm>`_ are in active development.

    What is Fortran used for?

Fortran is mostly used in domains that adopted computation early--science and engineering. These include numerical weather and ocean prediction, computational fluid dynamics, applied math, statistics, and finance. Fortran is the dominant language of High Performance Computing and is used to `benchmark the fastest supercomputers in the world. <https://top500.org/>`_

    Should I use Fortran for my new project?

If you're writing a program or a library to perform fast arithmetic computation over large numeric arrays, Fortran is the optimal tool for the job.
