# TRANSPOSE
## __Name__

__transpose__(3) - \[ARRAY MANIPULATION\] Transpose an array of rank two


## __Syntax__
```fortran
result = transpose(matrix)
```
## __Description__

Transpose an array of rank two. Element (i, j) of the result has the
value __matrix(j, i)__, for all i, j.

## __Arguments__

  - __matrix__
    : Shall be an array of any type and have a rank of two.

## __Returns__

The result has the same type as __matrix__, and has shape \[ m, n \] if
__matrix__ has shape \[ n, m \].

## __Examples__

Sample program:

```fortran
program demo_transpose
implicit none
integer,save :: xx(3,5)= reshape([&
    1,  2,  3,  4,  5,    &
   10, 20, 30, 40, 50,    &
   11, 22, 33, 44, -1055  &
 ],shape(xx),order=[2,1])

call print_matrix_int('xx array:',xx)
call print_matrix_int('xx array transposed:',transpose(xx))

contains

subroutine print_matrix_int(title,arr)
! print small 2d integer arrays in row-column format
implicit none
character(len=*),intent(in)  :: title
integer,intent(in)           :: arr(:,:)
integer                      :: i
character(len=:),allocatable :: biggest
   write(*,*)trim(title)  ! print title
   biggest='           '  ! make buffer to write integer into
   ! find how many characters to use for integers
   write(biggest,'(i0)')ceiling(log10(real(maxval(abs(arr)))))+2
   ! use this format to write a row
   biggest='(" > [",*(i'//trim(biggest)//':,","))'
   ! print one row of array at a time
   do i=1,size(arr,dim=1)
      write(*,fmt=biggest,advance='no')arr(i,:)
      write(*,'(" ]")')
   enddo
end subroutine print_matrix_int

end program demo_transpose
```

Results:

```
    xx array:
    > [     1,     2,     3,     4,     5 ]
    > [    10,    20,    30,    40,    50 ]
    > [    11,    22,    33,    44, -1055 ]
    xx array transposed:
    > [     1,    10,    11 ]
    > [     2,    20,    22 ]
    > [     3,    30,    33 ]
    > [     4,    40,    44 ]
    > [     5,    50, -1055 ]
```
