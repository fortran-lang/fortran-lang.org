# Choosing a compiler

A comprehensive list of available compilers is provided [here]({{site.baseurl}}/compilers). In this guide, we will focus only on those that are free to install and use.

Of those listed at the link above, open source and free are GFortran (with OpenCoarrays), Flang, and LFortran. NVIDIA and Intel offer their compilers for free and as of the latest update of this tutorial, NVFortran (NVIDIA) is available only for Linux systems, while Intel oneAPI is available for Linux, Windows and macOS systems. Both are well documented and readers can find detailed information about installing and using them on their websites respectively. 

In the next chapter, we use GFortran for the tutorial as it is a mature open source compiler. We encourage users to also try other open source and commercial compilers.
