We're happy to announce six students that will work on Fortran projects under
the Google Summer of Code 2021 program:

* [Aman Godara](https://github.com/aman-godara) will work on strings in the
  [Fortran Standard Library](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib). Aman's
  mentors will be [Sebastian Ehlert](https://github.com/awvwgk) and
  [Milan Curcic](https://github.com/milancurcic).
* [Rohit Goswami](https://github.com/haozeke) will work on the
  [LFortran](https://lfortran.org) compiler, specifically toward the capability
  to compile a complex physics package. Rohit's mentor will be
  [Ondřej Čertík](https://github.com/certik).
* [Jakub Jelínek](https://github.com/kubajj) will work on handling compiler
  arguments in the
  [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm). Jakub's
  mentors will be [Laurence Kedward](https://github.com/lkedward) and
  [Brad Richardson](https://github.com/everythingfunctional).
* [Chetan Karwa](https://github.com/chetankarwa) will work on the linked list
  support in the
  [Fortran Standard Library](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib). Chetan's
  mentors will be [Arjen Markus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus) and
  [Milan Curcic](https://github.com/milancurcic).
* [Thirumalai Shaktivel](https://gitlab.com/Thirumalai-Shaktivel) will work
  on the Abstract Syntax Tree generation in the [LFortran](https://lfortran.org)
  compiler. Thirumalai's mentor will be
  [Ondřej Čertík](https://github.com/certik).
* [Gagandeep Singh](https://github.com/czgdp1807) will work on the support
  of arrays and allocatables in the [LFortran](https://lfortran.org) compiler.
  Gagandeep's mentor will be [Ondřej Čertík](https://github.com/certik).
  Gagandeep was accepted under the NumFOCUS application to GSoC.

This is the first year that Fortran-lang applied for Google Summer of Code, and
we're beyond excited that our project was allocated this many student slots.
You can follow students' progress in their weekly reports in the [Fortran Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/) forum.

Thank you, Google, for your support of Fortran and open source software!
