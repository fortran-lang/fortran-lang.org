Ondřej Čertík ([@ondrejcertik](https://twitter.com/ondrejcertik)) and 
Milan Curcic ([@realmilancurcic](https://twitter.com/realmilancurcic)) spoke 
yesterday about the future of Fortran in Episode 40 of the Open Source 
Directions Webinar.
We discussed the current state of the language, how it's currently developed, 
and what we can do today to build the Fortran community, ecosystem of packages, 
and developer tools.
