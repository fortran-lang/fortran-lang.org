Welcome to the October 2020 edition of the monthly Fortran newsletter.
The newsletter comes out on the first calendar day of every month
and details Fortran news from the previous month.

# fortran-lang.org

This month we've had only one minor change to the website:

* [#136](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/pull/136):
Small fix in the opening sentence on the compilers page
  
Ongoing work:

* [#117](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/issues/117): Adding a
  Benchmarks section, a new dedicated repository was created at
  https://github.com/fortran-lang/benchmarks and many details have been
  discussed in [issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/benchmarks/issues) there.

[Let us know](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/issues) if you have any suggestions for the website and its content.
We welcome any new contributors to the website and the tutorials page in particular - see the [contributor guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started.

## Fortran Standard Library

This month we've had an improvement to the `stdlib_ascii` module,
as well as addition of logging facilities.

* [#238](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/238): Improvements to the `stdlib_stats` module by adding explicit conversions.
* [#228](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/228): Implementation of the `stdlib_logger` module.
It provides a global logger instance for easy use in user applications, as well as a `logger_type` derived type
if multiple concurrent loggers are needed.
See the [logger specification](https://stdlib.fortran-lang.org/page/specs/stdlib_logger.html)
to learn more.

Work in progress:

* [#239](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/239): Implementation of the `stdlib_bitsets` module. It provides a bitset data type.
* [#235](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/235): Improvements to the `stdlib_ascii` module



Otherwise, ongoing discussions continue:

* [#225](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues/225): Name convention for derived types in stdlib
* [#224](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues/224): Handling and propagating errors inside stdlib
* [#221](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues/221): API for a bitset data type
* [#201](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues/201): API for file system operations

The candidate for file system operations to be included in stdlib is being developed by
[@MarDiehl](https://github.com/MarDiehl) and [@arjenmarkus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus)
in [this repository](https://github.com/MarDiehl/stdlib_os).
Please try it out and let us know how it works, if there are any issues, or if the API can be improved.

## Fortran Package Manager

This month has seen over a dozen additions and improvements to the Fortran implementation of fpm:

* [#186](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/186): Implement version string validation and comparison
* [#185](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/185): Update CI workflow
* [#182](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/182): CLI interface to further development of subcommands
* [#180](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/180): Recursive source discovery
* [#178](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/178): Add more example packages
* [#177](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/177): Allow selective testing of single suites and tests
* [#175](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/175): Updated formatting of Markdown documents
* [#174](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/174): Cache Haskell Stack build in CI
* [#171](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/171): Increase test coverage of fpm manifest
* [#170](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/170): Source parsing tests
* [#163](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/163): Use different strategy to fetch git dependencies
* [#162](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/162): Updated OS type identification
* [#160](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/160): Add contributing guidelines
(you can read them [here](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/CONTRIBUTING.md))
* [#157](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/157): Implement reading of fpm.toml
* [#155](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/155): Internal dependencies and build backend


Work in progress:

* [#193](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/193) (WIP): Local path dependencies
* [#190](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/190) (WIP): Auto discovery of executables
* [#189](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues/189) (WIP): Implement `fpm new`

fpm is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Try to use it. Does it work? No? Let us know! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/PACKAGING.md) to learn how to build your package with fpm.
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.


## Compilers

### Classic Flang

We continue to evaluate and merge pull requests into the original Flang
compiler again. We pulled in several changes in the past month.

One important merge was support for LLVM 10,
which required the use of a new fork, the _classic-flang-llvm-project_
fork of the LLVM monorepo. See
[PR#1](https://github.com/flang-compiler/classic-flang-llvm-project/pull/1)
for details.

Other recently merged pull requests into Classic Flang include:
* [PR#658: Fix in preprocessing for Flexi app](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/pull/658)
* [PR#737: TRAILZ function added to the fortran compiler](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/pull/737)
* [PR#756: Fix ICE interf:new_symbol_and_link symbol not found](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/pull/756)
* [PR#888: flang gen-exec does not show routine variables with parameter attribute; there are multiple pull requests that this includes (details below)](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/pull/888)
* [PR#916: Fix off-by-one error in minimum integers](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/pull/916)
* [PR#921: Correction of representation of string (character type) constants](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/pull/921)

The Classic Flang biweekly call has been set up to discuss issues and plans
for the next pull requests to be validated and merged. Our next calls will be
Wednesday, October 7 and 21, 8:30 AM Pacific time. The notes from previous
calls, upcoming agenda and a link to join the call can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OuiKx4d7O6eLEJDBDKSRnSiUO2rgRR-c2Ga4AkrzOI).

### LLVM Flang

Work continues on LLVM Flang, concentrating on semantics, lowering and runtime
sufficient to compile and run Fortran 77 programs.

In conjunction with the MLIR-based code from the _fir-dev_ fork (the Fortran
IR used for lowering), Flang can compile and run most F77 programs,
including the Fortran Compiler Validation Suite (FCVS).
We continue to work on refactoring necessary to upstream the _fir-dev_ fork into LLVM
flang proper.

Arm has contributed changes toward a full-fledged driver for flang.

AMD continues to add support for OpenMP semantics and lowering.

Valentin Clement continues to contribute parsing and semantics changes for
OpenACC support. This will be the topic of the next Flang Technical Community call
on Monday, October 5, 8:30 AM Pacific Time.

Michael Kruse continues to add support for building Flang on Windows with MSVC.
