[Let us know](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/issues) if you have any suggestions for the website and its content.
We welcome any new contributors to the website and the tutorials page in particular - see the [contributor guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started.

## Fortran Standard Library

Here's what's new in `stdlib`:

* [#239](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/239): Implementation of bitsets in `stdlib_bitsets`.
* [#243](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/243),
  [#245](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/245),
  [#252](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/253),
  [#255](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/255): Various improvements to `stdlib_logger`.
* [#245](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/245),
  [#250](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/250): Minor fixes to the CI.

Work in progress:

* (WIP) [#240](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/240): Implementation of the `stdlib_stats_distribution` module. It provides probability distribution and statistical functions.
* (WIP) [#189](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/pull/189): Initial implementation of sparse matrices.

Don't hesitate to test and review these pull requests!

Otherwise, ongoing discussions continue:
* [#220](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues/220): API for file system operations: directory manipulation
* [#241](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues/241): Include a `split` function (202X feature)
* [#254](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues/254): Proposition to add a logger for debug phases and levels among the different logs.

The candidate for file system operations to be included in stdlib is being developed by
[@MarDiehl](https://github.com/MarDiehl) and [@arjenmarkus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus)
in [this repository](https://github.com/MarDiehl/stdlib_os).
Please try it out and let us know how it works, if there are any issues, or if the API can be improved.

`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/PACKAGING.md) to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/manifest-reference.md) to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OuiKx4d7O6eLEJDBDKSRnSiUO2rgRR-c2Ga4AkrzOI).

### LLVM Flang

Work continues on LLVM Flang, concentrating on semantics, lowering and runtime. Significant contributions are being made for OpenMP and OpenACC support.

In conjunction with the MLIR-based code from the _fir-dev_ fork (the Fortran IR used for lowering), Flang can compile and run most F77 programs, including the Fortran Compiler Validation Suite (FCVS).

Pat McCormick is (still) working on an RFC for the merge of the lowering code
in the fir-dev fork into LLVM master. (This was interrupted by Supercomputing 2020 and other ECP duties.) The goal is to expedite this in a way that is acceptable to the Flang community, so we can do further work in the single master branch.

Recent updates include:
* Johannes Doerfert has created a web page at https://flang.llvm.org; you can find call and Slack logistics there
* Nichols Romero has an llvm-dev RFC for adding Fortran tests to the llvm-tests project: http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2020-November/146873.html
* Andzrej Warzynski has a flang-dev RFC regarding flang option names: http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/flang-dev/2020-November/000588.html
* Andzrej Warzynski has a cfe-dev RFC regarding refactoring clang to help flang driver become independent of clang: http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2020-November/067263.html
* Changed representation of CHARACTER data in type system to make more consistent with other types (for arrays)
* Changed COMPLEX expression representation to provide better handling in lowering
* More improvements for supporting Fortran 77 programs
* Implemented runtime support for basic ALLOCATE/DEALLOCATE and further work
* Continued implementation of table-driven runtime for derived types; posted documentation
* Continued implementation of array expression lowering
* Improved error checks on forward references
* More updates to flang driver (option handling; -E can now be used to invoke just the Flang preprocessor)
* OpenACC semantic checks for modifiers on enter/exit data, set directives
* OpenACC lowering (enter/exit data, update, init, shutdown, wait directives)
* OpenMP structure checker updates; semantic checks for copyin clause; schedule class


## Events

Brian will serve in his first term until November 2023. Congratulations, Brian!
