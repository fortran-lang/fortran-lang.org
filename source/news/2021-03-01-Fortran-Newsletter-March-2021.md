Please help improve stdlib by testing and reviewing these pull requests!

The candidate for file system operations to be included in stdlib is being developed by
[@MarDiehl](https://github.com/MarDiehl) and [@arjenmarkus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus)
in [this repository](https://github.com/MarDiehl/stdlib_os).
Please try it out and let us know how it works, if there are any issues, or if the API can be improved.

`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/PACKAGING.md) to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/manifest-reference.md) to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.
* Browse existing *fpm* packages on the [fortran-lang website](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/fpm)
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

Accepted mentor organizations will be announced on March 9.
If you're a student, or know students who are [eligible to participate](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation), and you'd like to help build the Fortran ecosystem please reach out and let us know.

* The 223rd meeting of the US Fortran Standards Committee is held virtually from
  February 22 to March 2 (Monday and Tuesday only).
  Main topics of dicussion are the planned changes for the Fortran 202X revision
  of the Standard:

    * [List](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/meeting/223) of all submitted papers
    * [Summary](https://github.com/j3-fortran/fortran_proposals/issues/199) of which papers were discussed each day and voting results

  If you have ideas for new improvements to the language, please propose them
  [here](https://github.com/j3-fortran/fortran_proposals).

As usual, subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.io/g/fortran-lang) and/or
join the [Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group) to stay tuned with the future meetings.
