We are excited to announce that Fortran-lang has been accepted as a [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2021 mentoring organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6633903353233408)! 🎉

You can review our project ideas

and if you have any ideas that are not mentioned, please let us know.

We are looking for students to get in touch with us and to apply.

for instructions on how to do so.

Our main communication channel will be the [Fortran Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/).
There, we will announce a date for GSoC video calls where all prospective
students are welcome to join to ask questions, discuss, and brainstorm ideas.

We look forward to a productive and fun Google Summer of Code!
