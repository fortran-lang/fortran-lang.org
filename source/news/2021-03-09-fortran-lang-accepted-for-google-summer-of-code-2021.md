# Fortran-lang accepted to Google Summer of Code 2021
We are excited to announce that Fortran-lang has been accepted as a [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2021 mentoring organization](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6633903353233408)! ðŸŽ‰

You can review our project ideas
[here](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/wiki/GSoC-2021-Project-ideas),
and if you have any ideas that are not mentioned, please let us know.

We are looking for students to get in touch with us and to apply.
Click [here](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org/wiki/GSoC-2021-Student-instructions)
for instructions on how to do so.

Our main communication channel will be the [Fortran Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/).
There, we will announce a date for GSoC video calls where all prospective
students are welcome to join to ask questions, discuss, and brainstorm ideas.

We look forward to a productive and fun Google Summer of Code!
