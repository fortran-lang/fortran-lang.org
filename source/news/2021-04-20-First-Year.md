# First year of the Fortran website
In April 2020 we created a website for the Fortran language at
[fortran-lang.org](https://fortran-lang.org/). In exactly one year, it grew to
be the first result when you search "Fortran" in Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo,
Ecosia, Qwant, SearchEncrypt and the second result in Google (after the
Wikipedia page for Fortran).

The goal of the website is to maintain a neutral place where any Fortran user
(expert or novice), compiler vendor (open source or commercial), Fortran
Standards Committee member, enthusiast, supporter or anybody else interested
is welcome to participate. Fortran was invented in 1956, and we aim to be the
stewards of the language and we welcome you to join us.

Here are some of the ways that you can participate:

* [Fortran Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/) discussion forum
* Contribute to [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/),
  [stdlib](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/),
  the [Fortran website](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortran-lang.org) or
  any other project
* Join our monthly Fortran call (see announcements at Discourse)
* Contribute to the Fortran monthly newsletter
* Follow our Fortran Twitter account
  [@fortranlang](https://twitter.com/fortranlang)

Thank you everybody for your support so far. We are looking forward for the
second year!
