The candidate for file system operations to be included in stdlib is being developed by
[@MarDiehl](https://github.com/MarDiehl) and [@arjenmarkus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus)
in [this repository](https://github.com/MarDiehl/stdlib_os).
Please try it out and let us know how it works, if there are any issues, or if the API can be improved.

## Fortran Package Manager

Here's what's new in `fpm`:

* [#342](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/342):
  Fix broken link in contributing guidelines
* [#337](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/337):

* [#335](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/335):
  Fix: performance regression
* [#334](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/334):
  Remove a name clash in the fpm testsuite

Work in progress:

* [First beta release](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/milestone/1) (WIP):
  First feature-complete release of the Fortran implementation.
* [#230](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/230),
  [#261](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/261) (WIP):
  Specification of the fpm CLI.
* [#316](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/316) (WIP):
  Update subcommand "new" to reflect the addition of support for examples
* [#345](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/345) (WIP):
  Update: fpm\_backend with dynamic openmp scheduling

`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/PACKAGING.md) to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/manifest-reference.md) to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.
* Browse existing *fpm* packages on the [fortran-lang website](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/fpm)
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

* This year fortran-lang will be applying as a mentor organisation for [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
We have started working on the application and the project ideas; you can join the ongoing discussion [here](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/google-summer-of-code-2021/658).
If you'd like to help us flesh out the ideas, or have a project idea of your own, please join our upcoming video calls on February 9 and 16 (call info will be posted in the Discourse thread), or write directly in the Discourse thread.
If you're a student, or know students who are [eligible to participate](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation), and you'd like to help build the Fortran ecosystem please reach out and let us know.

As usual, subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.io/g/fortran-lang) and/or
join the [Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group) to stay tuned with the future meetings.
