Please help improve stdlib by testing and [reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22reviewers+needed%22)!

The candidate for file system operations to be included in stdlib is being developed by
[@MarDiehl](https://github.com/MarDiehl) and [@arjenmarkus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus)
in [this repository](https://github.com/MarDiehl/stdlib_os).
Please try it out and let us know how it works, if there are any issues, or if the API can be improved.

`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/PACKAGING.md)
to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/manifest-reference.md)
to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.

* Browse existing *fpm* packages on the [fortran-lang website](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/fpm)
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.
