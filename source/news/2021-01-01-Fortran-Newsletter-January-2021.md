`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/PACKAGING.md) to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/manifest-reference.md) to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.
* Browse existing *fpm* packages on the [fortran-lang website](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/fpm)
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

## Compilers

### Classic Flang

There are several pull requests out for evaluation.

Only one pull request was merged in December:

* [PR#951 Fix for ICE in atomic instruction generation](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang/pull/951)

### LLVM Flang

Alexis-Perry Holby (aperry@lanl.gov) has taken over the Flang biweekly calls.
An invitation was sent to the _flang-dev_ LLVM email list on December 22nd.
Call notes will be sent to the _flang-dev_ email list and also recorded [here]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/10T-S2J3GrahpG4Ooif93NSTz2zBW0MQc_RlwHi0-afY).

Recent development updates:

* Semantic analysis fix for index-names of `FORALL` statements
* Continued work on parser support for `ALLOCATE`
* Build tidying
* OpenMP semantic checks: atomic, flush
* Continued work on new driver
* Fix for list-directed REAL output editing
* Bug fixes: USE of USE of generic, crash in folding (#48437), crash in OpenMP semantic check (#48308), `IMPLICIT_NONE(EXTERNAL)`
* Implement `STORAGE_SIZE()`, `SIZEOF()`, and `C_SIZEOF()`
* OpenACC: update serial construct clauses for 3.1, enforce restriction on routine directive and clauses
* OpenMP: adding important clauses to OmpClause, task reduction clause

## Events

* We had our 7th Fortran Monthly call on December 15.
You can watch the recording below:

As usual, subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.io/g/fortran-lang) and/or
join the [Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group) to stay tuned with the future meetings.

* [Episode 6](https://adspthepodcast.com/2021/01/01/Episode-6.html) of the
Algorithms+Data Structures=Programs (ADSP) Podcast discussed Fortran and
the recent fortran-lang developments.
* [First year of Fortran-lang](https://medium.com/modern-fortran/first-year-of-fortran-lang-d8796bfa0067) by Milan Curcic.
