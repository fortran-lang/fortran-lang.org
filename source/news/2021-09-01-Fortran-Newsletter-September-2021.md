Please help improve stdlib by testing and [reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22reviewers+needed%22)!

The candidate for file system operations to be included in stdlib is being developed by
[@MarDiehl](https://github.com/MarDiehl) and [@arjenmarkus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus)
in [this repository](https://github.com/MarDiehl/stdlib_os).
Please try it out and let us know how it works, if there are any issues, or if the API can be improved.

`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/PACKAGING.md) to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/manifest-reference.md) to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.
* Browse existing *fpm* packages on the [fortran-lang website](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/fpm)
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

## FFTPACK

Zuo Zhihua ([@zoziha](https://github.com/zoziha)) and Ondřej Čertík ([@certik](https://github.com/certik)) started maintaining the public domain project FFTPACK under the Fortran-lang namespace.
The project is readily available for usage in with fpm.

Here is what is new in FFTPACK:

* [#10](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fftpack/pull/10):
  Add `(i)qct/dcosqi/dcosqf/dcosqb` interfaces for quarter wave data.
* [#7](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fftpack/pull/7):
  Add `dzffti/dzfftf/dzfftb` interfaces
* [#4](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fftpack/pull/4):
  Improve fft interface for `complex` sequences: `(i)fft/zffti/zfftf/zfftb`
* [#6](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fftpack/pull/6):
  Add  `(i)rfft/dffti/dfftf/dfftb` interface and ready to move to `fortran-lang`
* [#5](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fftpack/pull/5):
  Add `fftshift/ifftshift`
* [#3](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fftpack/pull/3):
  Add CI: fpm.yml

### Work in progress

* [#11](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fftpack/pull/11) (WIP):
  Add `(i)dct/dcosti/dcost` interfaces.

Feedback and ideas for this project are welcome.

## Compilers

### Flang

Recent development updates:

* New Driver and CMake integration:
    * The new driver has replaced the old, hence f18 has been deleted. 
    * flang-new (aka. the new driver) now drives the flang bash script before an external compiler is called.
    * Code-generation work is ongoing.
    * Work is now proceeding to enable CMake to recognize the compiler and set the appropriate options for build configurations.
* FIR (Fortran IR - a dialect of MLIR):
    * Fortran 95 lowering and runtime support is nearing completion, particularly of intrinsics
    * Code upstreaming will begin again in earnest once F95 is deemed complete
* OpenMP
    * Nesting of region semantic checks
    * enter_data MLIR to LLVM IR lowering
    * Semantic checks for allocate directive
    * Lowering for various modifiers for the schedule clause
    * Pretty printer and parser for omp.target operation
    * Semantic checks for linear, nested barrier, allocate directive
    * Progress with firstprivate, critical, collapse, ordered, reduction
* Lift -Werror checks into local functions
* Document the flang wrapper script
* Fix the extent calculation when upper bounds are less than lower bounds
* Fix list-directed plural repeated null values at end of record
* Fix build failure on MacOS involving std::clock_t
* Fix error messages on Windows.
* Disable Plugins in out-of-tree builds
* Correct off-by-one error in SET_EXPONENT

Call notes are recorded and available upon request [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10T-S2J3GrahpG4Ooif93NSTz2zBW0MQc_RlwHi0-afY). Please contact Alexis Perry-Holby at aperry@lanl.gov for document access.
