Please help improve stdlib by testing and [reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22reviewers+needed%22)!

The candidate for file system operations to be included in stdlib is being developed by
[@MarDiehl](https://github.com/MarDiehl) and [@arjenmarkus](https://github.com/arjenmarkus)
in [this repository](https://github.com/MarDiehl/stdlib_os).
Please try it out and let us know how it works, if there are any issues, or if the API can be improved.

  First feature-complete release of the Fortran implementation.
* [#505](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/505) (WIP):
  quiet mode for #502
* [#498](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/pull/498) (WIP):
  Draft - Compiler flags profiles

`fpm` is still in early development and we need as much help as we can get.
Here's how you can help today:

* Use it and let us know what you think! Read the [fpm packaging guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/PACKAGING.md) to learn how to build your package with fpm, and the [manifest reference](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/blob/HEAD/manifest-reference.md) to learn what are all the things that you can specify in the fpm.toml file.
* Browse existing *fpm* packages on the [fortran-lang website](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/fpm)
* Browse the [open issues](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm/issues) and see if you can help implement any fixes or features.
* Adapt your Fortran package for fpm and submit it to the [Registry](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm-registry).
* Improve the documentation.

The short-term goal of fpm is to make development and installation of Fortran packages with dependencies easier.
Its long term goal is to build a rich and decentralized ecosystem of Fortran packages and create a healthy
environment in which new open source Fortran projects are created and published with ease.

## Compilers


### LFortran

* 49 Merge Requests [merged](https://gitlab.com/lfortran/lfortran/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=merged)
* Highlights
  * Improvements to array support in the LLVM backend and at the ASR level:
    array sections, allocatable arrays, and other improvements
  * Many parser fixes (`lfortran fmt` works on more projects): block data,
    common block, equivalence, custom operator declaration, flush, critical and
    event statements
  * More runtime functions: minval, maxval, real, sum, abs
  * Optional human readable mod files


## Events

* We had our 13th Fortran Monthly call on June 15.
You can watch the recording below:

* Joint J3/WG5 (Fortran Standards Committees) meeting was held virtually from June 21-30 (Mondays and Wednesdays only). You can find all the papers that were discussed [here](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/meeting/224). Highlights from the meeting:
  - Conditional expressions syntax for Fortran 202X ([paper](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/21/21-157r2.txt)).
  - Protected components specifications and syntax for Fortran 202X ([paper](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/21/21-168.txt)).
  - The generics feature planned for Fortran 202Y was discussed at depth ([paper](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/21/21-144r4.txt)).
  - Jeff Hammond (NVidia Corporation) is the new J3 member as a voting alternate to Bryce Adelstein-Lelbach.
  - Target year for Fortran 202X is 2023, subject to change.

* FortranCon 2021 will be held virtually from September 23-24, 2021. For more information, visit the [FortranCon website](https://tcevents.chem.uzh.ch/event/14/).

* Work has started for our Google Summer of Code program. You read about our students and their progress so far on Discourse: <https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/c/gsoc-2021/11>
  
As usual, subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.io/g/fortran-lang) and/or
join the [Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group) to stay tuned with the future meetings.
